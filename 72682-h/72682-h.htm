<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE IDLER'S DAY.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"Nature hath given us legs to go to our objects, not wings
to fly to them."&mdash;EASTWARD HOE.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The spring of 1841 was very mild, and this
enabled Cecil and Blanche to endure the
wretched, comfortless state of Mrs. Tring's
boarding-house, better than if the weather had
been more rigorous.  The cheapness, which
was now becoming more and more important
to them, was therefore a sufficient compensation
for the want of comfort.  They had renewed
their engagement, hoping that either
the comic opera, or the historical picture, would
so improve their circumstances as to admit of
their removal in the summer.
</p>

<p>
They had long awakened from their holiday
dream to find that, however pleasant the
change in their position, it was only pleasant
as a change; the novelty once worn off, the
scene appeared in all its ugliness; or rather,
let me say, appeared so to Cecil.  He was of
a luxurious habit, and felt privation keenly.
Blanche felt it less, and her love for him made
home happy.  She had never been so happy.
Cecil was all she could desire.
</p>

<p>
As may be imagined, Cecil once relaxing in
the energy with which he had begun to work,
never recovered his former happiness.  The
charms of society were charms he could not
withstand; the more so because he was fitted
for it, shone in it.  Having dined occasionally
at the club was sufficient to give him an
incurable disgust to the meagre fare Mrs. Tring
spread before him, and he consequently began
to absent himself more and more.
</p>

<p>
Added to this, his painting proceeded slowly.
"Inspiration," wait for it as he would, seemed
unwilling to descend upon him.  Then there
were so many days lost: sometimes the
weather was foggy, and that prevented him;
sometimes it was fine, and tempted him to
exercise; sometimes he had visits to pay;
sometimes men "looked in" upon him at his
rooms.  One way or another, the week slipped
from him without leaving behind it any record
of labour.
</p>

<p>
Besides&mdash;and this perhaps was one great
cause of his idleness, giving strength to the
other influences&mdash;he grew less satisfied with
his picture the nearer it approached its
termination.  Cecil was a man whose designs were
always finer than his productions, his sketches
gave a promise which his execution never
realized.  In this little trait we may see the
whole man.  It might serve as a description
of his character.  With a certain freshness,
delicacy, and even grandeur in his conceptions,
he wanted strength, energy, and mastery, to
endow them with vitality.  Who can wonder
that he raved about "genius," and scorned the
"mechanical labour" of mere technical execution?
</p>

<p>
When he contemplated his productions, he
grew impatient at their inadequacy to represent
his conceptions, and he threw the blame on
everything but on his own indolence and
caprice.  That broad line which separates
intention from execution&mdash;which makes the
thought a thing&mdash;which distinguishes the artist
from other men, by creating in art what other
men only create in visions&mdash;that broad line
Cecil wilfully overlooked.  He saw that he
had failed, and did not choose to see wherein
lay his failure.  He despised the "drudgery"
which was indispensable to success.  Disgusted
with his failure, he lost all courage,
and scarcely ever handled a pencil.
</p>

<p>
"When will your picture be finished,
Mr. Chamberlayne?" asked Mrs. Merryweather,
one morning at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, I cannot say," he replied; "works
of that magnitude require long consideration.
I could have produced it long ago, had I been
disposed; but I'm in no hurry."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know Mr. Bostock's paintings?"
</p>

<p>
Cecil replied that he did not.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's a beautiful painter, that he is!
Does peaches and mackerel so that you
wouldn't know them from real.  His pictures
give one an appetite&mdash;that they do.  I remember
once&mdash;it was very curious&mdash;Mrs. Henley,
a relation of mine who lives at Southampton&mdash;her
husband was in the customs&mdash;good situation,
as I have heard&mdash;and a strange creature
he was, with the queerest nose you ever saw,
and eyes just like a lobster's, one was always
alarmed lest they should tumble into his
waistcoat pocket!  Well, he married my relation,
Mrs. Henley, one of the best creatures!  She
often comes up to town, and I should so like
you to be acquainted with her, you'll be quite
pleased with her!  So, as I was saying, she
came up to town once, to manage a little
business, and enjoy herself at the same time.
Well, one day she called upon us.
Merryweather&mdash;my poor Merryweather was then
alive: who wouldn't have thought him good
for another thirty years at least!  He proposed
to take us both to the Exhibition; so we went.
It was a very hot day, I remember; intensely
hot.  Poor Merryweather was in a bath all the
time.  And as he stood in the octagon room, his
hat in his hand, wiping the perspiration from
his face&mdash;which was a sight of itself to
see!&mdash;complaining of heat, I suddenly spied one of
Mr. Bostock's pretty pictures&mdash;oh, it was a
love!  you can't fancy what a bunch of grapes
straddled across a few peaches surrounded
with egg plums!  'Lor,' says poor Merryweather,
'do look at that; isn't it <i>refreshing</i>.'  And
we all declared it was; and <i>so it was</i>."
</p>

<p>
Cecil, as usual, made a precipitate retreat at
the conclusion of this biographical anecdote,
and Blanche soon followed him.
</p>

<p>
"By George!" he said, puffing a huge
column of smoke from his mouth, "that
woman is insupportable.  I really must quit
this hole; at least if that toad squats in it."
</p>

<p>
"She amuses me," said Blanche.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky for you."
</p>

<p>
Blanche took up her work, and sat beside
her husband, who, stretched upon the sofa, a
cigar in his mouth, was at what he chose to
consider his morning meditations.  He
certainly did think; but thought of the club, of
society, of opera singers, and of his past life,
far more than he thought of his work.  From
time to time he spoke to Blanche, and the
subjects upon which he spoke were sufficiently
trivial to have told any one more clear-sighted
than she was, how little art occupied his
reveries.
</p>

<p>
His cigar finished, he put on a pair of white
kid gloves, and occupied himself for half an
hour cleaning them with india-rubber, whistling,
humming, and chatting all the while with
enviable <i>insouciance</i>.
</p>

<p>
That important business concluded, he rose,
kissed his wife, yawned, stretched his limbs,
looked out of the window, and then took up
his <i>bottes vernies</i>, which he began to rub up,
and brighten with a piece of wool dipped in oil,
whistling, humming, and chatting as before.
</p>

<p>
"What time is it, I wonder?" he said,
drawing out his watch, "nearly twelve! whew! how
the morning flies.  I must be off.  Where's
my coat, Pet?"
</p>

<p>
She gave him his coat, and in another half
hour he had completed his toilet, and was
ready to start.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, my Pet!" he said, embracing her.
</p>

<p>
"Shall you be home to dinner to-day, dearest?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am to dine with Lufton; and this
evening we go to Miss Mason's."
</p>

<p>
"Enjoy yourself!  God bless you, dearest!"
</p>

<p>
Another kiss, and our man of genius departed
for his studio.  Arrived there, he began
to consider whether it were not too late to do
anything that day.  It was near one o'clock;
at two, Frank was to call upon him.  They were
going to a morning conceit.
</p>

<p>
"It is decidedly useless beginning anything
to-day.  I'll just try over some of those songs
till Frank calls."
</p>

<p>
He sat down to the piano.  Having sung for
a quarter of an hour, he opened a French novel,
and was deep in that when his <i>fidus Achates</i>
appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Frank," said Cecil, as they strolled out
together; "I am going to ask you a question which
generally disturbs friendship, but which won't
alter ours, because you'll answer it candidly."
</p>

<p>
"Cis, I know what that exordium means.
Whenever a man begins in that solemn
circumlocutory manner he can have but one
object&mdash;money."
</p>

<p>
Cecil laughed, as he replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You have hit it, by George!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I have.  Do you think I have
borrowed so much money without learning every
symptom?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, Frank, without disguise, I want
to borrow a few pounds; old Vyner has not
relented, and his wife has not been lately with
any little contribution: but she can't be long,
it has been due some weeks."
</p>

<p>
"What has been due, old fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what she intends to give us."
</p>

<p>
Thus securely did Cecil rely upon that source
of aid.
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile," he added, "I am deucedly
hard up, and if you have a few pounds&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Make it shillings, Cis, and it will be quite
as impossible.  Egad! it is rather a queer
sensation for one who has been so long a borrower,
to be looked upon in the light of a <i>possible</i>
lender!"
</p>

<p>
"Say no more, Frank; you would do it if
you could, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"Damn my whiskers! if <i>you</i> are sure of it,
<i>I'm</i> not.  I doubt whether I <i>could</i> lend.  I
don't know the trick of it; I should feel as
strange and disreputable as if I were to pay a
bill.  Perhaps my friendship for you might
overcome that&mdash;&mdash;  I don't know&mdash;perhaps it
might.  But it is all speculation, so let us
trouble ourselves no more with it.  As a matter
of practice, judge how feasible it is when I
reveal to you the present state of my capital:
four shillings and some halfpence in current
coin, and eighteen pence <i>invested</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Invested, Frank! in what, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"In a bill-stamp: I take care to be provided
with that."
</p>

<p>
Cecil shouted with laughter, exclaiming,&mdash;"That's
so like you."
</p>

<p>
It was, indeed, a trait which painted the
man.  The value of the bill-stamp consisted, of
course, in the chance of meeting with some
obliging young gentleman who would consent,
"merely as a matter of form," to put his name
to the bill, which Frank would forget to take
up.  But this value was now the more precarious,
as that mere matter of form had been so
very frequently gone through, that he found it
excessively difficult to get it repeated.  As he
used to say,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We degenerate&mdash;damn my whiskers! we
degenerate fearfully: the principles of true
<i>politeness</i> are becoming effaced."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
ANOTHER LITERARY SOIRÉE.
</h3>

<p>
The soirée at Hester Mason's, to which they
went that evening, was very much the same as
the one formerly described; there were fewer
guests, and among them more women: a sure
sign that she was getting on in the world, and
that the reputation of her parties was beginning
to cover any suspicious circumstances in her
own position.
</p>

<p>
But the women were still of a questionable
class: questionable, I mean, not as regards
propriety, but <i>ton</i>.  There were no ladies who
gave parties, who were recognised as belonging
to "society;" and, above all, there were no
girls there: the virgins were old, ugly, or wise.
</p>

<p>
In a word, the women were almost exclusively
literary women; described by Cecil as
poor faded creatures, who toiled in the British
Museum, over antiquated rubbish which they
extracted and incorporated with worse rubbish
of their own&mdash;women who wrote about the
regeneration of their sex&mdash;who drivelled in
religious tales&mdash;compiled inaccurate histories&mdash;wrote
moral stories for the young, or unreadable
verses for the old&mdash;translated from French
and German (with the assistance of a dictionary,
a dashing contempt for English idiom),&mdash;learned
women, strong-minded women, religious women,
historical women, and poetical women; there
were types of each class, and by no means
attractive types.
</p>

<p>
One remark Cecil made, which every one
will confirm.  "How curious it is," said he,
"to notice the intimate connexion between
genius and hair.  You see it very often in men,
but universally in women, that the distinguishing
mark of literary or artistic pretension is not
in the costume, but in the mode of arranging
the hair.  Women dress their hair in a variety
of ways: each has a reference to what is
becoming; but when women set up for genius or
learning, all known fashions are despised, and
some outrageous singularity alone contents them.
Just look round this room.  There is Hester
herself: she is young and handsome; but
instead of taking advantage of her black curls,
she trains them up like a modern Frenchman.
If you only saw her head, you would call it a
boy's.  Then, again, next to her sits Mrs. James
Murch&mdash;she reads Greek, and writes verses;
you see it by the hair parted on one side, instead
of in the centre, and by the single curl plastered
on her brow, emulous of a butcher boy.  There
is Miss Stoking&mdash;she writes history and talks
about the 'Chronicles'&mdash;I see that in the row
of flat curls on her forehead, and in the
adjustment of her back hair.  Miss Fuller must be a
philosophical woman, by the way in which all
the hair is dragged off her forehead.  That bony
thing next to her must be a poetess, by the
audacity of her crop.  In fact, depend upon it,
as there is a science of phrenology, there is
a science of hair."
</p>

<p>
These women did not, as may be guessed,
give any additional charm to Hester's parties,
unless, indeed, in the shape of some fun.
Nevertheless, their presence was inexpressibly
delightful to her, for it was a sanction; and with
all her sneers at the "conventions" of society,
Hester was most anxious to preserve them.
</p>

<p>
Cecil, who liked Hester very much, and was
interested even in her opinions which he did
not share, was pitiless in his satire upon her
female friends; which I will not repeat here,
lest the reader should imagine that <i>I</i> share the
general dislike to clever women&mdash;a conclusion
against which I protest, and stoutly.  True, I
am not so blind an admirer of cleverness as to
think it atones for the absence of womanly grace,
gentleness, lovingness, and liveliness; but, on
the other hand, some of the most charming
women&mdash;and <i>womanly</i> women too&mdash;I have ever
known, have been distinguished in literature
and art.  Will that avowal save me?
</p>

<p>
Hester forgave Cecil for his opinion, the more
so as she shared it; and although she combated
his views on social matters as warmly as ever,
was falling over head and ears in love with him.
</p>

<p>
"You will come round to my way of thinking
one day," she said; "so elevated a mind as
yours cannot long remain a slave to traditionary
sophisms; the Spirit of the Age will claim you."
</p>

<p>
"Pray," said Cecil, smiling, "can you explain
to me what this spirit of the age actually is?
I hear a great deal about it, and comprehend
nothing that I hear.  Is our age so very different
from all those that have gone before it?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly: it is the age of progress."
</p>

<p>
"Progress? but <i>that</i> is the characteristic of
all ages; society never stands still."
</p>

<p>
"True, but sometimes it retrogrades, and now
it advances.  My dear Mr. Chamberlayne, you
will not deny that the peculiarity of our age
is not only progress, but consciousness of
progress."
</p>

<p>
"That is to say, I suppose, while our
forefathers contented themselves with advancing,
we prate about our advance.  Now, of that kind
of consciousness I am as decided an enemy as
Carlyle himself; and his eloquent denunciations
of it as the disease of our time find full
acceptance from me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! my dear sir, Carlyle, with all his
genius, does not understand the historic
development of humanity."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not; nor do I: though I have tried.
But it still seems to me an evil, not a benefit,
that our modern reformers are so very conscious&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!  You will not deny that every man
should have a Purpose?"
</p>

<p>
Cecil, who knew this was one of the magnificent
aphorisms of the "earnest" school, paused
for a reply.  Seeing him hesitate, Mr. Jukes, a
sickly red-haired republican, with a feeble
falsetto voice, stammered forth&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is it p-p-p-possible, Mr. Ch-ch-chamberlayne,
you can hesitate to p-p-pronounce that
e-e-every man should have a p-p-p-purpose?"
</p>

<p>
There was something so marvellously
ludicrous in the feebleness of the individual,
contrasted with the apparent vigour of his doctrine,
that Cecil could with difficulty restrain his
laughter, and hastened to say&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"By no means&mdash;by no means.  I presume
every one <i>has</i> a purpose; but, then, the question
is&mdash;what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"If you admit," said Hester, "that a man
must have a Purpose, it is surely unreasonable
to wish him not to be distinctly conscious of it:
then, only, can he best fulfil it; otherwise, he
is a mere machine in the hands of fortune.  I
say, therefore, that the consciousness of our age
is the consciousness of progress; each man of
any real eminence has a Mission, and he knows
it; that Mission is to get the broad principles of
Humanity in its entire Developments fully
recognised.  That Mission," she continued, with
rising warmth, "is to sweep from the face of
the earth the worn-out sophisms which enslave
it; to give Mind its high Prerogatives; to cut
from the heart of society the cancer of
Conventionalism which corrupts it; to place Man in
majestic antagonism to Convention; to erect the
Banner of Progress, and give the democratic
Mind of Europe its unfettered sphere of action."
</p>

<p>
"A grand scheme," replied Cecil, smiling;
"but how is all this to be accomplished?"
</p>

<p>
"By indomitable re-re-resolution; b-b-b-by
f-f-f-ixity of p-p-purpose," suggested Jukes.
</p>

<p>
"By a recognition of the rights of women,"
sternly remarked the philosophical Mrs. Fuller.
</p>

<p>
"The Greeks," began Mrs. James Murch,
"whose literature&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here she was interrupted by Miss Stoking,
who thought that if readers were not so fond of
"trash," and would only look into the
"Chronicles," something considerable might result.
</p>

<p>
The epic poet&mdash;the celebrated author of
"Mount Horeb, and other Poems"&mdash;thought
the age was not religious enough: there was not
enough divine aspiration in the souls of modern
men to bring about any grand revolution.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Blundell (the kind of "Boz," as his
friends told him) thought that there was a
deficiency of wit, and referred to a "government
tempered with epigrams" as his ideal.
</p>

<p>
Hester would admit of nothing but the
"broad Principles of Humanity:" upon these
she stood.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Mason," said Mrs. Murch,
"surely the Greeks, whose literature&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And women?" interposed Mrs. Fuller.
"Are women not destined to play a great part
in the reformation of society?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" replied Hester; "the greatest
part&mdash;I am quite of your opinion.  Society
must be reorganized, and in its new structure
women must fill their proper place; they must
be consulted&mdash;their rights must be recognised.
You have no idea," she added, turning to
Cecil, "what an enormous difference there
would be if society were reconstructed with a
view to the equal partition of power between
man and woman."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he said, laughing; "I
have a very formidable idea of it.  In fact, I
think there is already too great a preponderance
of female influence."
</p>

<p>
A chorus of indignant astonishment followed
this from all the ladies, except from Mrs. Murch,
who, pertinaciously sticking to her yet
unexpressed idea, began&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now, my belief is that the Greeks, whose
literature&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You protest," said Cecil, not noticing
Mrs. Murch, "against my dictum?  But hear me.
The gradual softening of manners, by constraining
men to relinquish their advantage in physical
force, has destroyed the balance of power,
and <i>unbeaten woman</i> has the upper hand."
</p>

<p>
Hester laughed; the philosophical Mrs. Fuller
frowned; and Mrs. Murch fastened
upon poor Blundell, to expatiate to him in
confidence on the literature of the Greeks; but
even here she was not allowed to proceed far
before he interrupted her with the question&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Had the Greeks a 'Boz?'"
</p>

<p>
She turned from him with a look of withering
contempt.
</p>

<p>
All this while Frank Forrester was engaged
at a corner card-table, winning an ambitious
young farce-writer's money at <i>écarté</i>; having
emptied his pockets of seven pounds and a few
shillings, Frank rose from the table and joined
the talkers.  But Cecil's jest had changed the
conversation, and as it was getting late he
prepared to depart.
</p>

<p>
"What! going so early?" reproachfully
asked Hester.
</p>

<p>
Had Cecil been a vainer man, or one caring
less for his wife, that look and tone would have
been plainly significant to him; but he noticed
nothing, and merely said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"They are waiting up for me at home."
</p>

<p>
"And your wife will scold you," said she,
pettishly.
</p>

<p>
"No; but worse than that&mdash;I shall reproach
myself."
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hand coldly, and wished
him good-night.

CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE TIGER TASTES BLOOD.
</h3>

<p>
"Cis, my boy," said Frank, as they stepped
into the street, "you have made a conquest
there; poor Chetsom!"
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!" said Cecil, "don't be absurd,
Frank; she knows I'm married."
</p>

<p>
Frank stopped&mdash;turned him round to look
him full in the face&mdash;and then whistled.
</p>

<p>
"Cis, your innocence&mdash;if it be not hypocrisy&mdash;is
worthy of a primitive age.  Married!  She
knows you're married!  Ha! ha! ha!  By
George! you remind me of that vaudeville we
saw last year at the <i>Variétés</i> in Paris, where
Lafont embraces Ozy, who repulses him with&mdash;<i>Mais,
Mosieu, j'aime mon mari</i>; to which Lafont,
stupefied at such innocence, as I am at yours,
replies&mdash;<i>Tiens! tu aimes ton mari? c'est bizarre,
sans doute; mais enfin ce n'est pas defendu!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Joke as you please; I repeat, Hester knows
I am married, and may easily see that I have
no disposition to be unfaithful."
</p>

<p>
"Cis, you ought to have a statue!  Damn
my whiskers!"  They walked on for some
moments without speaking.  "By the way, Cis,
you asked me to lend you some money.  I
hadn't it then, I have now.  I won a few
yellow boys of a conceited ass who had the
amiable weakness of fancying he could play
<i>écarté</i>&mdash;and with me too&mdash;with me!  It is
but a paltry seven that I won, but that properly
placed must bring in more.  I think you
have never played <i>rouge et noir</i>, have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Never; nor do I intend."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense! look here: Men always win
at first: it's an invariable rule.  Fortune always
seduces youngsters with smiles.  Now, I'll lend
you five pounds, if you will try your luck, and
give me a third of your winnings."
</p>

<p>
Cecil refused, was pressed, and refused
again: but he never could withstand Frank for
any length of time, and ended by accompanying
him to a gambling-house.  They knocked
at the door; and after a scrupulous examination
on the part of the porter, who did not at first
recognise Frank&mdash;no one being admitted except
when introduced by a frequenter of the
house&mdash;they ascended to the drawing-room, where
they found a rather numerous assembly.
</p>

<p>
There were three tables.  That in the centre
was the most attended: it was the <i>rouge et
noir</i> table.  That on the left was devoted to
roulette; that on the right to hazard.  There
was a low hubbub and confusion of voices,
above which rose these sounds:
</p>

<p>
"Make your game, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"The game is made."
</p>

<p>
"Seven's the main."
</p>

<p>
"Red wins."
</p>

<p>
Cecil approached the centre table, and was
instantly made way for by two lookers-on.  At
the side centre sat the dealer, before him two
packs of cards placed together; beside him
two croupiers.  Opposite sat two croupiers,
and a man who collected and shuffled the
cards.  Piles of gold, bank notes, and silver
counters were glittering on the table, enough
to awaken the spirit of gain in the most prudent
breast.
</p>

<p>
It was a painful sight.  The features of the
players were distorted by anxiety; those of
the dealer and croupiers had become hardened
into masks, more hideous in their sodden
calmness than agitation could have made them.
</p>

<p>
Painful, also, the contrasts afforded by the
players.  Some were reckless, others calculating;
some were feverish in their impatience;
others lost in quiet despair small sums which
to them were fortunes; while several passed
hours together pricking a card with a pin, and
trying to wrest the secret of the capricious
goddess, by counting the turns of her wheel; then,
after as much calculation and patience as would,
if directed to any honest employment, have
produced a tangible result, hazarding their
solitary half-crown, and losing it in
astonishment and dismay.
</p>

<p>
Seedy, withered men were also there, whose
whole existence depended upon their trivial
gains; who daily risked their few shillings,
content to retire with a few shillings gain,
which they took home to their wretched
families&mdash;and if they lost, content to abide the
loss, without further risk that day.  There was
one man there who bore the unmistakeable
marks of a gentleman, in spite of the worn,
anxious face and seedy dress; he was never
known to miss an evening, and never to play
more than four coups on each evening.  His
stake was invariably half a crown, and it was
rare indeed that he did not win three coups
out of the four&mdash;timing his stake with such
knowledge of the chances.  With the seven
and sixpence or ten shillings he thus gained,
he supported a wife and five children.
</p>

<p>
Is there not something singularly distressing
in such an existence?  To struggle daily with
the capricious turns of fortune for a miserable
three half-crowns, and to gain that only by
consummate self-mastery!  Yet there are men
who choose such a life, rather than one of
honourable labour; men who have mastery
enough over their passions to be cool at the
gaming-table, yet not sufficient mastery to keep
<i>from</i> it!  This would be inexplicable did we
not know the powerful attraction of all exciting
uncertainty: did we not recognise the inherent
desire for emotional excitement which is
implanted in every heart.  In honourable labour
such men have not learnt to seek their
excitement&mdash;they find it at the gaming-table; and
hence the fascination of gaming.  It is to be
noted, in confirmation of what has just been
said, that inveterate gamesters are thoroughly
aware of the enormous disadvantage at which
they play&mdash;thoroughly convinced the bank must
win&mdash;yet they play!
</p>

<p>
The scene was new to Cecil, and affected
him painfully, as it always does those who are
not carried away by the passion of gaming;
but he was there to play <i>once</i>, and he
surmounted his disgust; inwardly vowing that
whatever might be the fortune of that night,
he would never repeat the experiment.
</p>

<p>
The room was singularly quiet, considering
how many persons were assembled.  The
sounds of bottles being uncorked, the clatter of
glasses, and the chink of money were distinctly
audible; conversation being carried on for the
most part in whispers.
</p>

<p>
Cecil played.  Frank, trusting entirely to the
good fortune which so proverbially favours
beginners, abstained from giving him any advice.
He played at random and lost.  His five pounds
were soon gone.  Frank slipped the other
two into his hand; they followed the others.
As the last crown disappeared, Cecil saw a
young man heap together a pile of notes and
sovereigns; huddling them into his pocket, he
called for some champagne, and having drunk
it, departed.  He came down stairs at the same
moment with Frank and Cecil, in high spirits.
</p>

<p>
"That's what we ought to have done," said
Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you force me to play?" said Cecil,
bitterly; like all weak men, throwing the blame
of his own folly upon others.
</p>

<p>
"Who the devil would have supposed you
could lose the first time?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;it is a bit of experience.  Perhaps
I have bought it cheap after all."
</p>

<p>
He walked home, however, as angry as if he
were by no means so satisfied with the bargain;
and Blanche, who was sitting up for him as
usual, was surprised to find him so out of
humour.  He was sometimes tired when he
came home, but always ready to talk freely
with her, and recount the adventures of the day.
That night he was taciturn, and gave evasive
short replies to all her questions; till at last
she saw that he was unwilling to talk, and left
him in peace.
</p>

<p>
He was restless that night.  It was long
before he went to sleep; and when he did fall
into a fitful doze, he was troubled by strange
dreams of the gaming-table.  Sometimes he
was playing with a pile of notes before him;
sometimes he had lost every shilling, and awoke
in his despair&mdash;to find himself in bed.

CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE YOUNG FATHER.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Life is too short for mean anxieties;<br>
  Soul! thou must work, though blindfold.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KINGSLEY.&mdash;<i>The Saints' Tragedy.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The next morning Cecil had almost regained
his cheerfulness.  The thought of last night's
loss would occasionally dash his spirits, for
seven pounds, in his situation, was not a trifling
sum.
</p>

<p>
"When is your mother going to send us any
money?" he said; "does she imagine we can
get on without it?"
</p>

<p>
"I expect her every day; but perhaps, dear,
she has not been able to save any."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw! if she chose&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
"When will your opera be ready, dearest?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know&mdash;but soon, I hope.
Something must be done, Blanche, for our
condition is really pitiable.  Thank God, we have
no children!"
</p>

<p>
Blanche trembled, and coloured violently as
he said this; but summoning courage, she laid
her hand upon his shoulder and asked,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why thank God for that, Cecil?"
</p>

<p>
"Why? because it is a great blessing."
</p>

<p>
"And should we not think children a blessing?
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated; and then went on,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say, Cecil, you would not
be very proud and very happy to dandle a child
of your own&mdash;with your own dear eyes and
lovely smile?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I don't like brats."
</p>

<p>
"But your children would not be brats.
Oh! you would love them, I know you would;
you would be as proud of them as I should.
Only think, how darling it would be to have a
little cherub here with us&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes&mdash;there's the sentimentality of
women!  They only think of the cherub&mdash;not
of the red, squalling, slobbering, troublesome
baby.  They only think of the pleasure of
dandling, kissing, hugging, dressing, and
attending on it;&mdash;it is a plaything to them, and
they never think of the expense."
</p>

<p>
"No, dearest Cecil, they do not; nor would
<i>you</i>.  The love for our offspring which God
has planted in our hearts, is too pure, too healthy
and unselfish, not to override every other
feeling.  The poorest parents are always glad to
have more children, because more children
means more love."
</p>

<p>
A sudden suspicion crossed him; he seized
hold of her, and looking closely in her face,
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Blanche, it strikes me you have some motive
for pleading in this way in favour of children.
I never heard you so eloquent before.
Let me know the worst.  Are you&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
She hid her blushing face in his bosom, and
pressed him to her convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" was his brutal exclamation.
</p>

<p>
A vision of a large family and destitution stood
before him, and his heart sank at the prospect.
</p>

<p>
"Are you not glad?" she asked him gently,
not raising her face from its resting-place.
</p>

<p>
"Glad!" he exclaimed with vehemence,
"glad at the prospect of bringing children to
share our poverty?  Glad, when I know not
how we are to exist ourselves, to learn that
fresh burdens are come upon us?  This is a
nice place to rear a child in!  It will have
every comfort; we shall be so comfortable:
such a nursery!  And when I come home
harassed from my day's work, wanting repose
and quiet, a squalling baby will be so
pleasant!  Glad; yes, yes, there's a great deal to
be glad about!"
</p>

<p>
She crept from him, and sank upon a chair.
</p>

<p>
"How the child is to be provided for, God
only knows.  We can't stop here.  They would
not keep us with the nuisance of a child in the
house.  We must seek some miserable lodging
of our own, and there live squalidly.  And to
think of your being rejoiced at such an event:
that is so like women!"
</p>

<p>
Her little heart was breaking, and half stifled
sobs burst from her as he continued.  It was
indeed a fearful trial for the young mother!
She had hoped to see him as proud and happy
as herself; she had hoped that the child would
be a fresh link between them&mdash;a link which,
by making their poor home more cheerful to
him, would have kept him oftener with her.
And this was his answer!
</p>

<p>
She covered her face in her hands, and wept
scalding tears of heart-breaking misery.
</p>

<p>
Her sobs pierced his heart; he could not
withstand them.  He loved her too dearly to
see her sorrowing unmoved; and forgetting in
that sight all his selfish fears and calculations,
he caught her in his arms and exclaimed,
"Blanche&mdash;my own beautiful Blanche! don't
cry&mdash;I am a brute&mdash;I did not mean it&mdash;indeed
I did not.  Look up.  There; see, I <i>am</i> glad;
I will be glad.  You are right.  My fears were
foolish.  We shall be all the happier!  Don't
sob so, my blessed one&mdash;you kill me!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cecil, Cecil!" she sobbed, as she
threw her arms round him convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"My own pet, don't cry now.  I was taken
by surprise.  I only thought of our poverty.
You are right.  Poorer people are happy in
their children, why should we not be?  Dry
your eyes, beauty.  There; you see I am quite
come round.  I hope it will be a girl: a dear
little petkin, just like its darling mother.
Fancy a toddling Blanche! won't it be a
beauty?  It must be christened Blanche&mdash;eh?
Or suppose it's a boy, what name shall we
give it?  Tell me, beauty."
</p>

<p>
She only kissed him feverishly; she could
not speak: her trembling agitation was not
yet subdued, and the tears continued to fall fast.
</p>

<p>
"What a Turk he will be; won't he?  Just
like his mother&mdash;you are a Turk, you know, pet!"
</p>

<p>
Blanche smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
"There, you begin to smile&mdash;that's right.
I see I am forgiven.  Dry your eyes, they
are quite swollen.  You don't look at all
handsome when you cry&mdash;no, not at all.  There,
now you laugh you are yourself again&mdash;laugh
away those tears, or I will take your portrait
as you are, and your children shall see their
mother as the Niobe of the nineteenth century.
Will you be painted as Niobe?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed again, but it was slightly
hysterical.  However, by caresses and cajoleries,
he brought her round at last, and her eyes
were dried.  They were soon talking over the
prospects of their children, as if nothing had
occurred; an occasional sigh&mdash;the mere physical
effect of previous grief&mdash;alone recalling
the moment of agony she had escaped.  Cecil
was afraid to leave her, lest she should relapse,
so he proposed to take her into town to see
the exhibition of old paintings at the British
Institution.
</p>

<p>
Blanche was perfectly happy.  She had been
but too readily persuaded that he was, on
reflection, really delighted at the prospect of a
family; she wished so to believe it!  And he
was more charming and cajoling than ever.
</p>

<p>
Had she loved him less, the foregoing scene
would have completely disenchanted her; but
love sealed her eyes, and she saw no selfishness,
no unmanly weakness in his horror at the
idea of a child.  She saw nothing, in fact, but
what he chose her to see: his affection, and
his warm caressing manners.
</p>

<p>
Although Cecil never again allowed Blanche
to suspect that he was otherwise than delighted,
and although he even tried to convince himself
that, after all, there was nothing disagreeable
in having a family; that it was one of the
inevitable conditions of marriage, and therefore
should be accepted with cheerful resignation;
yet did the idea frequently depress him.
</p>

<p>
This much is to be urged in favour of the
unwillingness of fathers to incur the burden
of children: that while the maternal instinct
from the very first&mdash;nay, even in girlhood&mdash;makes
the woman look forward with anticipative
joy to the time of becoming a mother, the
paternal instinct is seldom developed until the
child is actually there to call it forth.  Fathers
love their children as much, or nearly so,
as mothers; but fathers do not, as mothers
do, love <i>prospective</i> children.  The man
contemplates the expense, trouble, and
responsibility of children, which the woman, with
beautiful improvidence, never thinks about;
but when the children are born, the man
joins the woman in forgetting, in their joy,
the drawbacks to their joy.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was just the man to make a doating
spoiling father to the very child whose
announcement made him so serious.
</p>

<p>
The seriousness with which he accepted his
lot would have been incalculably beneficial to
him, had he possessed a grain or two more of
moral resolution.  It impressed him once more
with the conviction of the necessity for work.
It stimulated him again to daily labour.  Warned
by the state of his finances, he relinquished the
idle dreaming of genius awaiting inspiration,
and began to set his shoulder to the wheel.
</p>

<p>
So strenuously did he work, that in less than
three weeks he finished his comic opera, words
and music, and had now to begin the arduous
task of getting it performed.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The termination of Cecil's opera was coincident
with that fearful scene recorded at the close of
our second volume, wherein Marmaduke avowed
his passion to Violet, and unwittingly achieved
his vengeance upon Mrs. Vyner.
</p>

<p>
On quitting the room, Violet had promised
him to renew their interrupted interview, but
she had made that promise unthinkingly, and
when in solitude she reflected on all that had
passed, felt herself unequal to it.  Greatly had
Marmaduke's confession relieved her, but greatly
also had it pained her.
</p>

<p>
She could now indulge her love for him without
remorseful bitterness and contempt, though
not with any hope.  He was reinstated in her
good opinion.  He was not false and fickle.
He had not loved Mrs. Vyner.  His attentions&mdash;those
attentions which had given her such pain&mdash;were
explained; and in her joy at the explanation,
she overlooked what had been criminal
in them, to see only that they did not affect his
love for her.  Well was it conceived by the
mythologists to make Love blind!
</p>

<p>
But this joy was dashed with the recollection
that he never could be hers.  All that had
transpired would prevent their union.  Neither her
father nor her step-mother could be expected to
give their consent; and with their consent, if it
were given, she still felt that her own must be
withheld.  How could she ever accept the man
who had been both seriously and treacherously
the lover of her father's wife&mdash;the man whom
that wife loved?
</p>

<p>
The horrible sarcasm in which Mrs. Vyner
bade her "accept her leavings," still rankled in
the proud soul of Violet, and created an
irremediable loathing.  It was under these mixed
emotions that she sat down and wrote the
following letter:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Your frankness deserves a frank reply.  I
feel myself unable to meet you again, after what
has passed,&mdash;you must understand why; but I
cannot refuse an answer to your declaration.
</p>

<p>
"If it be any consolation&mdash;if it alleviate the
pain my resolution may inflict upon you&mdash;know
that your love is returned.  Yes, Marmaduke,
I love you.  I tell you so without reserve,
without maidenly timidity.  I love you.  But the
very fearlessness with which I make this avowal
arises from the fixedness of my purpose.  It is
because I can never see you again, because our
union has become <i>impossible</i>, that I am tempted
to unveil my soul before you.  No, Marmaduke,
I was not playing with you; I was not
encouraging attentions because they flattered
my vanity&mdash;I encouraged them because I
loved.
</p>

<p>
"You asked me for forgiveness; and the deep
sad tones of your repentant voice are ringing in
my ears.  I do forgive you, Marmaduke; forgive
you all the pain your conduct gave me&mdash;I
can excuse your error.  I can feel that it was
a crime made almost venial by the circumstances
and your education.  The moment when,
with vengeance in your hands, you drew back
from its accomplishment, and acknowledged to
yourself that it was unworthy of a man, that it
was a crime, not an act of justice&mdash;that
moment purified your soul&mdash;that moment redeemed
you in your own eyes and in mine.
</p>

<p>
"But, Marmaduke, I cannot <i>forget</i> as easily
as I can forgive.  Nothing can banish from my
mind the hideous remembrance of what <i>has been</i>,
and what <i>is</i>.  The thought that you had once
loved <i>her</i> would poison all my happiness; and
the thought that she still loves you ... Oh! is
that not fearful?  You see how undisguisedly
I write to you!  It tears me to pieces, but it
must be done, once for all.  I shall not write
again.  I shall not see you again.  Far away
from you, I shall struggle with my sorrow, and
conquer it, I hope, in time.  Far away from
you, I shall not cease to think of you; and
memory will solace me with your image, I shall
hear your voice, see your deep eyes loving me,
press your hand, and so cheat my misery.  But
away from you I must go.  Must I not?  Do
you not see the necessity?  Do you not feel
that our union is utterly hopeless?  How could
we escape the circumstances of our unhappy
lot?  My father would never consent&mdash;<i>she</i>
would never consent; and if I renounced all, if
I fled with you from home and country, how
could I escape from my own conscience? how
could I forget?
</p>

<p>
"I renounce the hope of happiness.  I have
only now to bear with fortitude my wretched
fate.  Forget me, Marmaduke.  No, that is
an idle phrase&mdash;I do not mean it.  Do not
forget me; think of me, think of me often,
and love me still, if you can; at least pity me,
and imitate me.  Accept fate; bow your head
to its irresistible decree; but do not despair.
Life has other purposes than love; other
purposes even than happiness; let those occupy
you.  In this life we are separated, but we shall
meet above.  It is but a brief moment's pain,
and we shall then pass away into a brighter,
purer sphere, and have a whole Eternity to love
in; there our sorrows will be stilled; that let
us await!
</p>

<p>
"I have stained this paper with my tears&mdash;I
will not affect to hide them.  I must weep, for
my heart is breaking, Marmaduke; but I shall
not flinch.  I know what it is I am about to
do; know how much pain it will give me; but
I can do it, and I will.  Weep I must, for I am
a woman; but I can endure.
</p>

<p>
"If my tears make this almost illegible, do
not suppose that they will weaken me.  I am
unalterable.  Tears strengthen me; they relieve
the tightness of my straining heart; I do not
check them.  I shall shed many, very many,
ere I quit this world; but life itself is very
short, and I look beyond the grave.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, my own beloved, and give
you courage to bear the inevitable!  Love me,
and pray for me.  God bless you!  Oh, how
it pains me to say&mdash;farewell!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"VIOLET."

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter was put into the post as the
miserable girl departed from home, on a visit to
her uncle in Worcestershire, with whom she
contemplated passing the remainder of her
days; certain that he would be but too happy
to have her, and feeling that home was now
uninhabitable.

CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
MAN PURIFIED BY EXPERIENCE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  My desolation does begin to make<br>
  A better life.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHAKSPEARE.&mdash;<i>Antony and Cleopatra.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Who shall describe the delight and grief of
Marmaduke on reading that letter?  She loved
him; but she refused him.  He saw as plainly
as she did the reason of her refusal, and bitterly
cursed himself for having drawn such a net
around him.  But was there no issue?  Could
nothing be devised which would in some way
remove this obstacle?  Nothing, nothing.
</p>

<p>
He called and was refused admittance.  He
wrote to Rose, who replied that her sister had
left London, but had enjoined inviolable secrecy
as to the place of her destination.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke had nothing to do but await in
sullen despair the hazard which might again
bring him into communication with Violet,
having failed in all attempts to get a clue to her
present residence.  But she loved him; that
was a sweet thought to alleviate his sorrow:
she loved him; and with that conviction he
could afford to await events.
</p>

<p>
He ceased almost to hold communication
with the world; shut up in his study he led a
solitary, meditative, studious life, strangely at
variance with his former occupations.  A noble
resolution had taken possession of his soul; the
conviction that he was loved by so great a
woman made him desirous of becoming more
worthy of her love.  Knowing Violet's high
thoughts and sympathy with greatness, he
resolved to make a name.  Parliament, the great
field of Englishmen's ambition, was the arena
chosen for the contest.  His previous education
had but ill-fitted him to make a display there;
yet to strong will, energy, and ability what can
be denied?
</p>

<p>
He set himself to the task with the impetuous
ardour which characterized all his acts.  He
studied history, political economy, and what
may be called political ethics.  He read and
re-read the orators, ancient and modern, not with
a view of copying their peculiarities, but to draw
therefrom certain general conclusions respecting
the art by which masses of men are swayed.
Burke, the great thinker, great orator, and
incomparable writer, was his constant
companion.
</p>

<p>
In this solitude his mind became strengthened,
nourished, and enlarged, and at the same time
his moral nature became more developed and
purified.  Nothing could ever eradicate certain
defects of his organization&mdash;defects which were
the shadows thrown by his best qualities.
Nothing could ever have made him calm,
moderate, unprejudiced, or self-sacrificing.
Passionate, reckless, and excitable Nature had made
him; and no education, no trials could alter his
disposition.  But these very qualities, with their
accompanying defects, fitted him for an orator,
whose splendid enthusiasm, overbearing
impetuosity, audacious courage, and irresistible
bursts of passion were capable of swaying
mankind.  He was born to command and to lead;
education and a high purpose were now fitting
him for the office.
</p>

<p>
While he was thus acquiring the means
wherewith an honourable name is made, he was
also gaining those clear moral ideas by which
alone a great name can long be honourably
maintained.  The more he became aware of the
imperishable importance of high morality, the
more painfully did he recoil at the remembrance
of his unpardonable conduct with Mrs. Vyner.
The clearer his moral perceptions grew, the more
iniquitous, the more contemptible appeared his
passion for vengeance.
</p>

<p>
"What must Violet think of me?" was his
frequent self-questioning; and he shuddered at
the idea.  Henry Taylor has profoundly said,
that conscience is, in most men, the anticipation
of the opinion of others.  It is so in all men.
It is the horror we feel at contemplating the
probable judgment which those we respect and
love will form on our acts.  So it was with
Marmaduke.  He had learned to view his
conduct in its true light; he doubted not that
Violet must look at it with the same loathing;
and bitter reproaches assailed him.  Often and
often did he dwell upon that part of her letter
wherein she excused him; but it seemed so
slight, he could not believe her wholly sincere.
She was sincere when she wrote it, but would
not subsequent reflection show her, as it had
shown him, the whole affair under another
aspect?  It would&mdash;it must.
</p>

<p>
He forgot one thing: that he looked upon
his error with the anxious and probing severity
of one who repents, and that she looked upon it
with the blindness of one who loves!
</p>

<p>
For the sake of clearness, I have told you in
this chapter the history of several months, and
may now leave Marmaduke at his studies to
return to the other persons whose fortunes were
more varied.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
POOR VYNER.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Heav'n has no rage like love to hatred turned,<br>
  Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BYRON.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Meredith Vyner came into the drawing-room
and found his wife senseless on the floor,
he imagined she had been seized with a fit, for
he was unaware of Marmaduke having been in
the house.  Mrs. Vyner availed herself of the
supposition, and so escaped irritating inquiries;
she just mentioned that she had been very much
distressed and excited that morning, and that
doubtless her fit had been greatly owing to it.
</p>

<p>
"And what distressed you, my love?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I cannot tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; do dear, do tell me."
</p>

<p>
"Will you promise not to mention a word of
it to Violet?"
</p>

<p>
"I will."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, it was on her account.  You
know how I wished for a match between her and
young Ashley?  You know his audacious love
for me?  I tried to make him relinquish his
foolish hopes&mdash;I tried to lead him to think of
her.  He scorned the idea&mdash;vowed he loved me
and only me&mdash;and was so violent that I was
obliged to order him to quit the house, and never
to re-enter it.  He left me in a great passion.
It is a rupture for ever."
</p>

<p>
Instead of feeling in the least distressed at
this rupture, Meredith Vyner could not conceal
his joy.  What cared he for Violet's sorrow&mdash;was
not his rival got rid of?
</p>

<p>
He redoubled his attentions to his wife&mdash;now
wholly his, he thought!&mdash;and felt that the great
misery he had dreaded was now forever banished.
When Violet came to him, therefore, to ask
his permission to go down to her uncle, he gave
it willingly, and without inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke dismissed, how happy now would
the house be!  Mary would again become the
sprightly, cajoling, attentive wife; she would
again come into his study to hear him read
aloud; would again interest herself in Horace.
By the way, he had sadly neglected Horace of
late; not a single emendation had been made;
not a note written.  That could not continue.
He had no time to lose.  He was no longer
young.  If age should creep on before he had
finished that great work, what a loss to literature!
</p>

<p>
Alas! neither home nor Horace profited by
this dismissal of a rival.  The attentive wife
grew pettish, irritable, and more avowedly
indifferent than ever.  Her health was seriously
affected.  She was subject to hysterics, which
came on apparently without cause.  Her gaiety
had entirely disappeared, and she was often
found in tears.  She would rally from time to
time, and endeavour, in incessant dissipation, to
escape from the torment of her thoughts; but
this never lasted long; she soon relapsed again
into a capricious, fretful, malicious, melancholy
state of mind.
</p>

<p>
She had, indeed, received a deep wound.
That conscience which, in its anticipation of the
opinion of others, so troubled the studious
Marmaduke, was an awful retribution on
Mrs. Vyner.  The thought that he had duped her
and had excited her love&mdash;for she had loved
him&mdash;merely as a means of revenge, was of itself
sufficient to rouse her to exasperation; but
when to that was added the thought of Violet
knowing it&mdash;of the detested Violet who had
always seen through and scorned her, and who
now held the secret of her guilty passion&mdash;it
became a rankling poison in her soul.  Nor was
the fury of jealousy absent.  This villain who
had played with her, did he not love the haughty
girl who despised her?
</p>

<p>
The poor old pedant was at a loss to comprehend
the cause of his wife's conduct.  She could
not love Marmaduke, or why should she dismiss
him; yet, if she did not love him, why was she
so miserable?
</p>

<p>
In vain he tried by kindness to revive within
her that semblance of affection with which she
had hitherto cheated him.  She ceased all
hypocrisy, though hypocrisy would have been
kindness.  She received his demonstrations of
affection with exasperating indifference, and
when he, on one or two occasions, endeavoured
to exert his authority&mdash;for he was master in
his own house, he supposed&mdash;she only laughed
at him.
</p>

<p>
The poor old man retired to his books, but
not to read; in mute distress he ruminated on
the change which had taken place, and sat
there helpless and hopeless.  He tried to forget
these painful thoughts in occupying himself
with his great work; but he sat there, the book
open before him, the pen idle in his hand, and
the snuff-box his only consolation.
</p>

<p>
His domestic peace was gone, and he began
to perceive it.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
REHEARSAL OF THE OPERA.
</h3>

<p>
"Good news, pet," said Cecil, dancing into
the room one afternoon.  "Moscheles, whom
I meet sometimes, you know, at Hester
Mason's, has looked over my opera, and likes it
very much; he has even proposed that we
should have a sort of private rehearsal of it
at his house next week, and has undertaken to
secure the singers, and Bunn is to be there to
hear it."
</p>

<p>
"That is good news, indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we shall be rich now.  It has given
me fresh courage: I feel I can finish <i>Nero</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Mama has been here to-day with Rose,
and has brought us thirty pounds.  She is very
ill&mdash;very ill indeed, and the physicians don't
know what is the matter.  Rose and Violet are
already busy with the baby linen, and Rose
insists upon being godmother."
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart!  I'm so happy,
petkin!" and he danced about the room like a
schoolboy on receiving intelligence of a
half-holiday.
</p>

<p>
"We must move away from this hole at once,
pet.  We will take comfortable apartments
somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Let us rather wait awhile: the opera is not
accepted yet, you know."
</p>

<p>
"But it will be, and it must succeed&mdash;I feel
it must."
</p>

<p>
The gleam of hope which now shone on his
prospects made Cecil almost another man.  He
worked steadily at "Nero," and finished it before
the hearing of his opera took place.  It was
sent to the Academy.  When it took its place
in the Exhibition it would infallibly excite a
sensation: crowds would gaze enraptured on it:
critics would proclaim its merits in all the
journals, and some nobleman of taste would
become the proud purchaser.  Their prospects
were brilliant.  Happy dreams of young
ambition in its first struggles with circumstance!
How many a sad spirit have ye not soothed and
strengthened!
</p>

<p>
The hearing of his opera took place.  Moscheles
himself presided at the piano, playing
the accompaniments and overture with his
exquisite skill.  Henry Phillips, Wilson, Stretton,
and a certain prima donna, who shall be nameless,
were the singers, Cecil undertaking some
of the minor parts.  The choruses were omitted;
only the solos and concerted pieces were
executed, but they gave general satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Private rehearsals, like private readings,
are, however, always successful, and a little
excellence produces a great effect on friendly
auditors.  The singer thought so great by his
friends, whose success at parties is so brilliant,
finds to his cost that concert rooms and
audiences are not so easily pleased.  Bunn had
experience enough of such matters to be aware
of all this, and though he saw a chance of
success with the opera, he was rather guarded
in his language.  On the whole, however, he
was disposed to give the work a trial.
</p>

<p>
That satisfied Cecil.  He thought, the first
step gained, the victory was his.  Experience
came with its bitter lesson to undeceive him.
In the dramatic world, success is only
purchased by a series of hard-won battles.  In no
province of human endeavour has a man to endure
more thankless labour; in no province is
luck more potent.  To write a play or an opera
is the smallest of the artist's difficulties.  Once
written, he has to get the manager's acceptance:
few things more arduous than that, if the
artist be not already celebrated.  Cecil had by
a fortunate accident achieved this feat.  A
manager had listened to and approved of his
work.  In his innocence, Cecil imagined the
day was his own.  He knew nothing of actors
and singers.  The prima donna absolutely
declined to perform her part; so did the second
tenor.  And their reasons?  Their reasons were
simply these:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The heroine of the opera was a Miss Hopkins,
daughter of a vulgar cheesemonger.  H. Phillips
was willing to play the cheesemonger,
but the prima donna would not play the
daughter.  She had been used to play spangled
princesses, with feathers in her hair; or
picturesque peasants, with short petticoats and
striped stockings; and the idea of her appearing
as a cheesemonger's daughter, minus spangles,
feathers, short petticoats, and striped stockings!
In vain it was represented to her that the opera
was a comic opera; she did not wish to excite
laughter, but sentiment; and she was dogged
in her resolution.
</p>

<p>
The second tenor was a sentimental warbler.
He not only objected to Wilson playing the
best part, he also objected to his own part us
"out of his line."
</p>

<p>
Owing to the beautiful arrangements of our
dramatic system, the "stars" have not only
absolute right to dictate to authors and
composers, but also, in effect to dictate to
managers.  They would all cut down a play or
an opera to single parts if they could; and
while ludicrously sensitive to their own
reputation, are remorselessly indifferent to the
author's, as well as to the manager's purse.
</p>

<p>
What would Shakspeare, Jonson, Moliere,
or Calderon say, could they rise from their
graves to witness our beautiful dramatic system?
How is it some Churchill does not take the
whip in hand to lash this miserable arrogance
of the stage?  While vanity, pretension, and
injustice, in other shapes, are laughed at and
exposed, why do they escape when they appear
in the preposterous demands of actors,
singers, and dancers?
</p>

<p>
In his indignation, Cecil wrote a satire.
Unfortunately he was not a Churchill: his satire
was violent, but weak, and weak because of its
violence.  Besides, he was fighting his own
cause; <i>indignatio fecit versum</i>, and the public
only saw an angry author smarting from
imaginary or exaggerated injuries.
</p>

<p>
Cecil's discouragement may be imagined.
He who at no time was able to contend manfully
against obstacles, was the last person to
rise with the occasion and vanquish opposition
by determined will.
</p>

<p>
To complete his discouragement the Exhibition
had opened, and no wondering crowds collected
round his "Nero."  Very few of the
critics noticed it, and they noticed it coldly or
contemptuously.  One who recognised a certain
grandeur in the idea, was pitiless in his
criticism of the execution; which he pronounced
"crude," "chalky," "opaque," "slovenly,"
and "incorrect."
</p>

<p>
Cecil sneered at the "envy" and "ignorance"
of the critics, as authors usually sneer at those
who do not admire them; though why a man
who does not paint, should be "envious" of a
man who paints badly, I have not yet
discovered.  Vauvenargues has an admirable
remark: "Un versificateur ne connait point de
juge compétent de ses écrits: si on ne fait pas
de vers on ne s'y connait pas; si on en fait on
est son rival."  How constantly do painters
illustrate this remark!
</p>

<p>
Cecil parodied Coriolanus, and to his critics
said "I banish you."  He wrapped himself up
in his own greatness, and waited the impartial
judgment of enlightened judges.  By impartial,
he meant favourable: that is the meaning of
the word in every artist's lexicon.  No one, it
would seem, was enlightened enough, for no one
talked about "Nero;" above all, no one thought
of purchasing it.  The "envy" of critics seemed
to have been shared by connoisseurs and noblemen.
</p>

<p>
There is something really tragic in certain
conditions to which men of superior faculties
are daily subject, in their efforts to cut a
pathway for themselves through the crowded
avenues of fame.  Fancy the poor poet unable
to find a publisher, and unable to print his
work himself.  He cannot now, as heretofore,
stand up in the market-place, and so get a
hearing.  The press is the only possible mode
of proclaiming to the world, that which the
poet feels will rouse that world to rapture, and
will make him a sort of demigod.  Fancy the
young barrister sitting in his chambers day
after day, in fruitless expectation of a brief.
He cannot offer his services: he must wait till
they be demanded.  He can <i>do</i> nothing; but
must sit there day after day, day after day,
seeing little chance of being required, yet forced
to remain there on the chance.  Fancy also the
painter who sees persons crowding the
Exhibition, passing over his work, to look out for the
works of favourite artists, giving handsome sums
for various pictures, yet making no offer for
his.  Day after day this is renewed, till the
last hope ends with the closing of the
Exhibition, and he is then forced to congratulate
himself, if the dealers will give him a small
sum for what he considers <i>a chef-d'œuvre</i>.
</p>

<p>
The parent who has seen and reflected upon
this, and yet educates his son as an artist,
because it is a "fine thing" to be an artist;
the parent who suffers his self-love to blind
him to his child's want of a decided genius,
and chooses to call an ordinary aptitude
"genius," is with selfish vanity destroying that
child's future hopes of success in life.  Music,
painting, and sculpture, are arts founded on
instincts so strong, and so unmistakeable in
their early manifestation that unless the child
very early exhibits extraordinary faculty for the
arts, the parent should take Nature's warning;
and not endeavour by cultivation to raise that
flower which only grows wild in the secret spots
Nature herself selects.

CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
CECIL SUCCUMBS.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Now why must I disturb a dream of bliss,<br>
  And bring cold sorrow 'twixt the wedded kiss?<br>
  How mar the fate of beauty, and disclose<br>
  The weeping days that with the morning rose.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEIGH HUNT.&mdash;<i>Rimini.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Ever since that night when Cecil had first
entered a gambling-house, and lost the few
pounds Frank had lent him, the image of the
joyous winner huddling the notes and gold into
his pocket pursued him like a phantom.  He
had resolved to play no more; he could not
afford to lose; and his first venture had been
so unfortunate, that he could not hope hazard
would be in his favour.  Men have extraordinary
practical belief or disbelief in their own
"luck."  Ask a man if he seriously, theoretically
believes in anything of the kind, and he
will answer, No.  Yet that very man puts his
name down in a raffle, or cuts cards against an
adversary, or stakes large sums on any game of
chance, "because he always wins"&mdash;because
"he is so lucky."
</p>

<p>
Cecil believed himself to be "unlucky."  He
was therefore averse to gambling.  He had
played, and&mdash;"it was so like his
luck"&mdash;although the first time, yet he lost.
</p>

<p>
In spite of this conviction, the image of that
fortunate winner with his file of notes and
sovereigns, <i>would</i> force itself upon him.  While
he was painting&mdash;while he was reading&mdash;at his
meals&mdash;during his walks&mdash;while dozing in
bed&mdash;that figure stood before him crumpling the
notes, calling joyously for the champagne, and
sauntering down stairs in thorough self-content.
In his imagination he followed that young man
through a series of fortunate nights, during
which he had amassed a large sum, with which
he purchased a charming little house in the
country, and foreswore the gaming-table for ever.
It was a most coherent story, coherent as
imagination loves to be.
</p>

<p>
The real story may be told in few words:
three weeks after that prosperous night, the
winner, utterly ruined, poisoned himself!
</p>

<p>
Had Cecil known the real story it might
have made him pause; but he only knew what
he had seen, and fancy supplied the rest.
</p>

<p>
Like a tempting fiend did this image of the
winner pursue him&mdash;seductive, irritating; he
tried to banish it by thinking of his constant
ill-luck, but it would return, and his present
discouragement made the temptation stronger.
By art he could not live.  The age was too
material; the country too commercial.  Why
should he struggle and starve when the
gaming-table offered its facile resources?
</p>

<p>
"Frank," said he, "I wish you would take
me again to Jermyn-street."
</p>

<p>
"What! you want to try another <i>coup</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I have a presentiment I shall win.
At any rate, it is worth risking a few pounds."
</p>

<p>
"I am going there this evening.  Dine with
me at the club.  I will explain to you an
infallible martingale by which we <i>must</i> win.
Damme, I'll break all the banks in London."
</p>

<p>
"How? how?"
</p>

<p>
"You know enough, Cis, of the game to
understand my explanation.  The martingale is
this: always to back the winning colour, and
double your losses till you win.  Look'ye
here&mdash;Suppose I place a pound on the red, and
black wins; black is then the winning colour
and I back it; but having lost, I must double
my stake: so I put two pounds on the black.
Well, red wins, damme its eyes!  I have lost
three pounds.  What do I? place <i>four</i> pounds
on the red, which is then the winning colour.
If red wins again, I have recovered my three
pounds staked, and one pound over.  I back
red again, and again, so long as red continues
to win.  Directly black wins, I double my
stake, and regain my loss."
</p>

<p>
"I see, I see!"
</p>

<p>
"It's as clear as day.  The only possibility
of losing is, that red and black should
alternately win all the night through; but as that
never has been known, we must not think of
such a chance."
</p>

<p>
"But then you only win your original stake
each time?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course; but you are <i>sure</i> to win it.  The
only objection to our putting our scheme in
practice is the absolute necessity for a large
sum of money to begin with."
</p>

<p>
"How so, Frank?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, my dear fellow, you've no idea how
doubling your stake mounts up.  To stake a
sovereign, and lose ten <i>coups</i>, you must have at
least six hundred pounds in hand; for the
stakes run one, two, four, eight, sixteen,
thirty-two, sixty-four, one hundred and twenty-eight,
two hundred and fifty-six, five hundred and
twelve, and so on."
</p>

<p>
"Whew!"
</p>

<p>
"That's it."
</p>

<p>
"And we stake five hundred pounds to win a
sovereign?"
</p>

<p>
"Just so.  Unless you play the martingale
strictly, you cannot be certain of winning: but
you <i>must</i> win if you play it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! well, then I must give up the idea, for
I cannot raise the money.  Never mind, I'll
let chance play for me; martingale or no
martingale."
</p>

<p>
That night they went to the house in
Jermyn-street, where Cecil had first played.
</p>

<p>
Frank won five and forty pounds.
</p>

<p>
Cecil lost every penny.
</p>

<p>
"Frank, lend me five pounds: I am desperate."
</p>

<p>
"Here they are, old boy.  Play cautiously."
</p>

<p>
Cecil seized them with a greedy clutch.
</p>

<p>
"Make your game, gentlemen," said the
dull-eyed dealer.
</p>

<p>
Cecil threw the five sovereigns on the red.
</p>

<p>
The cards were dealt with leisurely precision.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Après</i>," said the dealer.
</p>

<p>
The croupiers, in accordance with the laws
of the same, deducted half the stakes on the
table.
</p>

<p>
"Is that your caution, Cis?" whispered Frank.
</p>

<p>
"It is my desperation," he said between his
teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Make your game, gentlemen!"
</p>

<p>
"The game is made."
</p>

<p>
"Red wins."
</p>

<p>
The perspiration burst from Cecil's pores, the
tightening suffocation in his breast was relieved.
He allowed the money to remain in its place
again to take its fortune.
</p>

<p>
"Make your game, gentlemen," said the
dealer in his unvarying voice.
</p>

<p>
"The game is made."
</p>

<p>
"Red wins."
</p>

<p>
There were now ten pounds upon the red
belonging to Cecil.
</p>

<p>
"Take up five," suggested Frank.
</p>

<p>
"No: hit or miss: I risk all."
</p>

<p>
The gambler's recklessness possessed him;
he was in such a state of excitement that he
knew not what he did.
</p>

<p>
"Red wins," again said the dealer.
</p>

<p>
Twenty pounds were now heaped upon the red.
</p>

<p>
"Shall you keep the stake there, sir?" asked
a smiling gentleman with bushy whiskers, who
had taken great interest in the game.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Cecil, resolutely.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall back against you," said the
smiling gentleman, twirling a whisker round
his finger, and throwing half a crown upon the
black, with the air of a man undertaking an
important enterprise.
</p>

<p>
"Red wins," again said the dealer.
</p>

<p>
"There's a run upon the red," sighed the
bushy-whiskered gentleman, as his half-crown
was raked away, and forty pounds stood there
as Cecil's winnings.  "I shall back you this
time, sir; you are fortune's favourite, sir.  Take
a pinch of snuff, sir."
</p>

<p>
And with recovered hilarity he offered the box
to Cecil, who bowed coldly, and took a pinch.
</p>

<p>
"Make your game, gentlemen," said the
dealer.
</p>

<p>
"Try the red again, Cis," said Frank, "but
take up five pounds to guard against accident."  He
staked twenty pounds himself upon the red.
</p>

<p>
Cecil followed his advice: he had now five
and thirty pounds staked.
</p>

<p>
"The game is made."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," said the bushy-whiskered
gentleman; "I have not yet staked."
</p>

<p>
He threw down a half-crown upon the red.
These three were the only players who backed
the red; upwards of two hundred pounds were
on the black; and the coup was watched with
breathless anxiety.
</p>

<p>
With unimpassioned, inexpressive face did the
dealer throw down the cards, as if all the chances
of the game which so excited the players were
powerless upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Red wins," he again said, in his hollow
indifferent voice.
</p>

<p>
Cecil raked the seventy pounds towards him
in a sort of delirium: the sight of the gold was
to him like a vision of fairy land.
</p>

<p>
The smiling snuff-taker snatched up his five
shillings, and again requested him to take a
pinch.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty game, sir; very pretty, when fortune
takes you in hand."
</p>

<p>
"We had better cut now," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Cis; come while you've got the money.
Don't tempt your luck too far."
</p>

<p>
"I must&mdash;I will play another coup.  I'll try
the red once more."
</p>

<p>
"Don't: be advised, Cis, don't."
</p>

<p>
"I must."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, wait till the next.  Let this deal
go by, and try the next."
</p>

<p>
Cecil did so.
</p>

<p>
"Black wins," said the dealer.
</p>

<p>
Frank looked at Cecil as much as to say,
"you see I was right."
</p>

<p>
Cecil smiled.
</p>

<p>
His smiling friend was glum, for he had
lost two crowns on the red.  He threw down
another couple of crowns again upon the red.
</p>

<p>
"Back the winning colour," said Frank,
staking twenty pounds upon the black.
</p>

<p>
Cecil made a pile of fifty sovereigns, and
placed it also on the black.
</p>

<p>
He won again.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Frank, I'm ready to go."
</p>

<p>
"That's right."
</p>

<p>
"Waiter, some champagne!"
</p>

<p>
"And a cigar, waiter!"
</p>

<p>
Cecil having called for the champagne, placed
the gold in his purse, and seemed to have
realized his dream: glimpses even of the country
house sparkled on the froth of the wine!
</p>

<p>
His brain was in a whirl, and the chink of
money, the rattle of the dice, the unvarying
phrases of the dealer, the brief remarks of the
players, all sounded like fairy music in his ears.
He was impatient to begone, for he felt that he
was succumbing to the fascinations of the
place, rightly named a 'Hell.'
</p>

<p>
As he went to the side table for his hat, he
espied his smiling neighbour standing looking
into the glass, with one hand under his chin,
fiercely pushing his whiskers forward so as
almost to cover his face, while with the other
hand he made terrific menaces at the reflection
of that face in the glass.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! you old fool!" he vituperated his own
image, at the same time shaking his fist at it.
"Did I not <i>tell</i> you so?  Did I not say you
would lose?  You ass! you ass!  <i>Five</i> and
<i>forty</i> shillings have you thrown away <i>this
blessed night</i>!  Five and forty <i>shillings</i>?  Will you
<i>never</i> learn wisdom&mdash;will you never <i>leave off
play</i>?  Ass! fool!  Ass!"
</p>

<p>
Cecil with difficulty restrained his laughter,
and advanced saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry you have not been fortunate, sir."
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i> are sorry, are you," fiercely replied the
little man, sharply turning round upon him,
delighted at having some one else on whom to vent
his wrath.  "And pray sir, who are <i>you</i>?  Who
are you, sir, that <i>presumes</i> to be <i>sorry</i> for <i>me</i>!
Am I an <i>ass</i>, sir? am I a <i>boy</i>? am I a <i>noodle</i>? to
be pestered by the pity of a <i>puppy</i> like <i>you</i>.
Do you wish to <i>quarrel with me</i>, sir? do you
wish to quarrel?  If so, say the <i>word</i>.  I am
not quarrelsome, myself; not I; but I <i>am not
to be bullied</i>, sir; you shall find that I am not
to be bullied.  <i>You may try it on</i>, sir&mdash;you will
find it <i>no go</i>!  And since you are <i>determined to
fight me</i>, sir, fight you <i>shall</i>.  You force me to
it, but I am not <i>one</i> to back out of it."
</p>

<p>
Cecil looked at him for a moment in surprise,
and then quietly turning on his heel, put an
arm within Frank's, and went down stairs.
</p>

<p>
The little fiery gentleman ran his fingers
several times through his whiskers, and then
turned again to vituperate his own repentant
face in the glass.  Having relieved his choler
thus, he called for some wine, and went home
to bed, pathetic and moralizing.
</p>

<p>
Cecil and Frank supped joyously that night,
and threw about their money with the lavish
recklessness of those to whom money so gained
loses its proper value.
</p>

<p>
Cecil came home exhausted with excitement,
and on his way ruminated how he should
deceive Blanche as to the source of his new
gains:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I will tell her I have sold my Nero for three
hundred pounds to a dealer, and this hundred
and twenty-five is the sum paid down.  That
will open the door for fresh winnings!"
</p>

<p>
How happy did this falsehood make his little
wife!  At last, then, her Cecil admitted that
something was to be done by art.  Their future
was secured.
</p>

<p>
Yet happiness grounded on such falsehoods
must be fragile; and far wiser would it have
been for Cecil to have told her the painful
truth.  She would have been shocked, terrified;
she would have entreated him to gamble no
more; there would have been "a scene," but
who knows what good might not have resulted
from it?
</p>

<p>
Cecil, like all weak men, sought refuge in a
falsehood from the reproaches which he knew
must follow an avowal.

CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
A GENTLEMAN'S LIFE.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  "Your days are tedious, your hours burdensome:<br>
  And wer't not for full suppers, midnight revels,<br>
  Dancing, wine, riotous meetings, which do drown<br>
  And bury quite in you all virtuous thoughts,<br>
  And on your eyelids hang so heavily<br>
  They have no power to look as high as heaven,<br>
  You'd sit and muse on nothing but despair."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DECKAR.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The next night and the next, Cecil played,
and with varying fortunes, sometimes losing to
the very last few pounds, at others rising to
large gains.  The end of the week found him a
winner of some four hundred pounds.
</p>

<p>
He considered himself rich now, and looking
on the gaming-table as a bank from which he
could at any time draw largely, his first step was
to move from Mrs. Tring's.
</p>

<p>
He took apartments in South Audley Street;
furnished them with taste, and considerable
luxury; engaged two servants, and began to
live in a style more corresponding with his
previous habits.
</p>

<p>
A run of luck in his favour having largely
increased his resources, he started a cab; and
boasted of one of the tiniest tigers in London;
a strong square-built boy of fourteen, who did
not look more than ten.
</p>

<p>
"Is this prudent, dearest?" said Blanche,
when he proposed the cab.  "Will our means
ever permit it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, pet, it is genuine prudence.  I am
the rage just now; the dealers are all anxious
I should paint them a picture.  Moon has
offered me a thousand guineas for one to
engrave from.  I have refused.  I must have
more.  But to command more it is essential
that I should appear rich; the richer I appear,
the richer I shall be.  A cab is, therefore,
policy."
</p>

<p>
"You know best: but don't forget the little
one that is to share our prosperity."
</p>

<p>
"Forget him, indeed! look here; I have
bought him a coral; look at the gold bells!  I
saw it yesterday&mdash;it was a bargain, and I
thought the opportunity should not be lost.
Isn't it beautiful?"
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful!  How thoughtful of you, dear one!"
</p>

<p>
"At the same time I saw a love of a watch.
That, said I to myself, is just the thing for
petkins&mdash;and behold!"
</p>

<p>
He held a gold breguet before her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You dear, kind creature," she said, kissing
him; "but I will not have you spend money on
me in this way."
</p>

<p>
She did not remark the diamond studs in his
shirt, nor the turquoise-headed cane which
dangled from his wrist; she only thought of
what he had spent upon a present for her.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was soon plunged into debt; but a man
who has his cab, and is lavish in expense,
easily finds enormous credit.  He lived as if he
had a certain income of two or three thousand
a year.  Brilliant dinners at the club, small
but ruinous dinners at home, suppers, jewellery,
cigars, gloves, and elegant trifles for his wife
demanded no inconsiderable sums.  Rouge et
noir and credit supplied his wants.  In spite
of heavy losses, his luck at play was
extraordinary, and was aided by his prudence in
always retiring after gaining a certain sum.
</p>

<p>
The ordinary routine of his life, as it used to
be at Mrs. Tring's, was now exchanged for
one very unlike it in appearance, but to those
who look beneath the surface very like it <i>au
fond</i>.
</p>

<p>
He rose late; and sat in his dressing-gown
and slippers, smoking cigars at two guineas the
pound, turning over the leaves of a novel or
new poem, chatting with Blanche, and listening
to her plans for the education of their children.
Impossible to be more charming than Cecil
at such moments!  He listened with unfeigned
pleasure to her little schemes, threw in a graceful
<i>bon mot</i> here and there, drew her on his knee,
and played with her golden hair, planned
amusements for her, and taxed his ingenuity to
discover what she would like to have bought.
</p>

<p>
About twelve, he dressed.  No rubbing up of
gloves&mdash;no oiling of boots now.  His dress was
a matter of study, and he stepped into his cab
a perfect dandy.
</p>

<p>
Blanche, without inquiring, imagined he
always went to his painting-rooms, but the club
or Hester Mason's were his invariable resorts.
</p>

<p>
He had taken of late to calling frequently
on Hester during the day.  Not that he was in
love with her, but she amused and flattered
him.  He saw pretty plainly that she regarded
him with anything but indifferent feelings, and
no man withstands that sort of flattery.  He
saw, moreover, that Sir Chetsom Chetsom was
jealous, and what man is insensible to that
compliment?  He went, therefore, and was
always amused.
</p>

<p>
Poor Hester had fallen seriously in love with
him, and although his attentions to her were
by no means explicit, yet she could not help
fancying he had some love for her.  Unfortunately
he often brought his wife's name forward,
and always spoke of her with an unostentatious
respect and affection which cut Hester to the
quick.
</p>

<p>
She who recognised no marriage tie; who
thought that love, and love alone, was the only
principle of union, was jealous and angry at
this obstacle of a wife, and her tirades against
marriage were not wholly unselfish.  That Cecil
loved her, she could not disbelieve&mdash;why, then,
should he not tell her so?
</p>

<p>
She did not appreciate the distinction
between flattered vanity and love; she did not
understand that a man could find delight in
her society, and be pleased at her evident
partiality, while at the same time cherishing the
image of his wife as something inalienable from
his heart.
</p>

<p>
Cecil had no thought of being inconstant, yet
he sought Hester's society with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
After spending an hour or so <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
her, he would drive down to the club, or into
the Park; dine at the club, and spend his night
at the Strangers', to which he had recently been
admitted, and where he played fifty pound
stakes with a recklessness which astonished
most of the players, but which, on the whole,
was attended with success.  One night he
carried off eight hundred pounds.
</p>

<p>
So large a sum in his possession betrayed to
Blanche the source of his sudden prosperity.
She had before been uneasy: doubts had
crossed her mind; the abundance of money,
coupled with his obvious idleness, looked very
unlike an artist's gains, and now this eight
hundred pounds threw a flash of light on the
mystery.
</p>

<p>
"Cecil, dearest Cecil," she said timidly,
"relieve me from my suspense&mdash;did you gain
this money at play?"
</p>

<p>
He looked angrily at her, and, puffing forth
a column of smoke, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How else should I gain it?"
</p>

<p>
She was silent.  He continued to smoke
fiercely for a minute or so, and then said,
sneeringly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Did you fancy money was to be gained by
art?  Did you imagine I was going to follow
the example of all the other fools, and wear out
my life in a miserable contest for a beggar's
pittance?  Painting would never support me;
it is all very well for the mechanical fellows
who make it a <i>trade</i>; I could never do <i>that</i>;
and I have no inclination to starve&mdash;there is
you to think of&mdash;and our child."
</p>

<p>
Blanche could not reply; every phrase was a
stab in her heart; she saw ruin and dishonour
scowling upon them, and felt their descent was
not to be averted.
</p>

<p>
"I was born a gentleman, thank God!" he
continued, throwing away the end of his cigar,
and rising from the sofa as he spoke; "I was
bred a gentleman, and, damme, I will live like
a gentleman!"
</p>

<p>
With this very gentlemanly, honourable
sentiment, he walked out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Relieved from the restraint of his presence,
Blanche threw herself upon the sofa, and gave
way to a paroxysm of grief.  What a blow to
her happiness was that fearful discovery!  Her
husband&mdash;her adored Cecil&mdash;a gambler!  Men
living in the world, and accustomed to mingle
with those who play, cannot overcome their
repugnance to a professed gambler; but what
is their repugnance compared with the loathing
felt by women, whose horror is unmitigated by
familiarity? and what is the abstract horror of
a woman, compared with the shuddering terror
of a wife, who sees written before her in
characters of fire the ineffaceable dishonour, the
inevitable ruin of her husband and her children?
</p>

<p>
A gambler! her husband was a gambler!
The luxuries with which she was surrounded
were not the fruits of honest labour, but of
dishonourable gaming; the trinkets which he had
given her, and which she had held as precious
tokens of his affection, were not purchased by
his genius and energy, but were purchased from
the misery of others; the gold he squandered
with a lavish hand, was the gold whose loss
carried perhaps despair and suicide into many
a wretched family.  The thought was torture.
It turned all her trinkets into manacles.  It
made the costly furniture around her dark,
grim, and reproachful.
</p>

<p>
Bitter, bitter were the scalding tears which
gushed from her, as she brooded on this
immeasureable horror!  Terrible were the
fears which assailed her as she thought of
the end&mdash;the inevitable end of such a
career!
</p>

<p>
All hope of happiness was now swept from
out her life.  Their love, which had been so
trusting; their sympathy, which had been so
perfect; her esteem, which had been so
unsullied, where were they?  Gone&mdash;irrecoverably gone!
</p>

<p>
In their poverty, how happy they had been! how
contented with their lot!  In the prospect
of the future, made radiant with love&mdash;in the
thoughts of their children, as sharers and
promoters of that love&mdash;what blissful dreams had
tinged with magic hues the far horizon of a
life which blended with the distant life to
come!  And now, in one single moment, all
those dreams were shattered, and the horizon
darkened with thunder-clouds over a stormy
sea.
</p>

<p>
You may have seen a graceful vine, heavy
with clusters of the purple grape, trailed up
against a garden wall; the rusty nail that
fastens it, half falling from out the crumbling
wall; and you have felt that the first gust of
autumnal wind must tear it completely out,
and hurl the poor drooping vine upon the
ground.
</p>

<p>
That is an image of their life.  By no
stronger bond were they now separated from
ruin: one turn of Fortune's capricious wheel,
and they were lost.
</p>

<p>
Weep, weep, poor wretched girl! weep and
prepare yourself for greater woe!  The babe
which now moves beneath your heart, in the
dim newness of its being, whose birth was
to have been the advent of such joy; what
will it be born to?  Weep, and prepare
yourself for greater woe!

GEORGE SAND.&mdash;<i>André.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The discovery of her husband's pursuits was
made too late.  Cecil had become a confirmed
gambler; and although he saw&mdash;saw with
anger and remorse&mdash;that his wife was
heartbroken at the discovery, and could not be
deluded by the fluent sophisms with which
he tried to persuade her that he had no other
career left&mdash;could not believe his present
pursuits were only temporary, to be given up as
soon as he had won sufficient money to be
independent; yet his remorse only tormented,
it did not cure him.  It made him uneasy at
home; made him seek excitement elsewhere,
in which to intoxicate his conscience.  And
he continued to win!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, had Violet been his wife, instead
of the meek, resigned Blanche, the greater
force of her will, and directness of her mind
might have cowed him.  Violet might have
shamed him into honour.  Her courage and
her inflexible will, by braving his anger, by
enduring scenes of domestic misery, but by
unflinchingly keeping to the point, might, with
one so weak, so impressionable, and so
affectionate, have rescued him from perdition.  But
Blanche was ill suited to such a task.  Her
spirit, never strong, had been early broken.
She had learned to endure evils, not to combat
them.  She bowed her head to the stroke, and
exerted all her strength in gaining fortitude to
endure.
</p>

<p>
Violet would have acted energetically, where
Blanche only wept in silence.
</p>

<p>
Her tears distressed and irritated him; they
made him impatient at her "folly," by bringing
painfully home to him the sense of his
own.  Yet, inasmuch as he loved her, he
could not see her constant melancholy
without anguish; and in moments of contrition he
had several times solemnly assured her that he
would never again touch a card.  The
assurance made her deliriously happy for a day
or two; but it never lasted long: he broke
his vow, made it again, and again broke it.
In fact, the fascination of the gaming-table
was irresistible; and Frank Forrester was
always at his elbow, like a tempter.  So often
had he deceived her, that she only smiled a
melancholy smile, when he now promised
never to play again.  She had resigned
herself to her fate as hopeless!
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, Cis," said Frank one day, "when
are you going to play scientifically?  You
might try the martingale now: you've got the
capital."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Frank, I lost six hundred pounds
last night&mdash;and that, too, in trying your famous
martingale."
</p>

<p>
"The devil you did!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and heartily I cursed you for having
told me of it."
</p>

<p>
"Justice, Cis, damme, justice!  If you lost
money by my martingale, it must be because
you didn't play it, for I'll stake my honour&mdash;or
anything equally valueless upon it, that my
plan is infallible."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so; if one could play it.  But the
fact is, one had need be a machine to play it."
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;of course.  That's why you
should have let me play: I'm cast-iron.  You
could not resist the temptation of risking now
and then, and in that risk you lost."
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell me, Frank.  No man can sit
playing all night, and winning paltry stakes,
when every time he wins he reproaches himself
for not having staked higher."
</p>

<p>
"So you lost?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm cleaned out.  I don't believe there is
eight pounds in my purse."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  I came to borrow."
</p>

<p>
"I'll accept a bill, if you will get it
discounted, and we'll share."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!"
</p>

<p>
"Have you a stamp about you?"
</p>

<p>
"Have I? ... My dear Cis, what a question!
Why bill-stamps are my stock-in-trade; when
the day&mdash;distant yet, I hope&mdash;shall arrive that
is to find me without a stamp, and without a
friend to go through the matter of form, then
will Francis Forrester gracefully bid adieu to
this dung-heap of civilization, and waft his
charming person into other regions.  Here you
are, old fellow!  just scrawl your name across
that: your coachmaker will discount it."
</p>

<p>
Having settled this little matter of business,
Cecil drove to Hester's.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Cecil found Hester writing, in a charming
négligé.  She threw down her pen with a
movement of impatient joy as he entered.
</p>

<p>
She took his outstretched hand in hers, and
pressing it tenderly, looked with serious alarm
into his face as she said, "You are not well.
Something is on your mind.  Am I right?"
</p>

<p>
"You are."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down on the sofa&mdash;there."  She sat by
his side still holding his hand, which he could
not withdraw.  "Now, tell me what it is."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you make me your confidante?  Am
I not worthy to share your sorrows?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me ... you are right .... I am
unhappy.  But I cannot tell you wherefore."
</p>

<p>
"How is your novel getting on?  Why won't
you tell me?"  She pressed his hand as she
said it.
</p>

<p>
He was perplexed, and knew not what to say.
Her dark eyes were darting forth fire&mdash;her face
was so close to his, that he felt its warmth&mdash;her
loose morning dress, thrown slightly open by
the attitude in which she sat bent forward,
made a dangerous display of her finely moulded
bust; he was surrounded with such an atmosphere
of voluptuousness, that his intoxicated
senses confused his reason.  In that moment
he forgot everything but the moment's intense
sensation.  His eyes answered hers; his hand
returned her pressure; he drank her breath,
and felt the blood flushing his face.
</p>

<p>
Both were silent; both feared to break that
silence.  With irresistible impulse they mutually
bent forward till their lips touched, and then
clung together in a burning kiss.
</p>

<p>
She burst into tears, and pressed him feverishly
to her, as if in an embrace to express the
unutterable fervour of her love.  And in this
delirium they remained some time, not a word
passing, only a few deep sighs, and a fierce
pressure of the hand, telling of the fire which
consumed them.
</p>

<p>
Hester was supremely happy.  Her doubts
were set at rest.  He loved her!
</p>

<p>
Cecil was violently excited, and in his
excitement forgot whom he was embracing&mdash;forgot
his wife&mdash;forgot the world.  The vague
suggestions of his conscience were stifled at once
by the agitation of his senses.  Hester by a
word recalled him to himself.
</p>

<p>
"You love me, then?" she said, tenderly.
</p>

<p>
He started, and could not answer her.
</p>

<p>
"Cecil, dearest Cecil, my own, my best
beloved!"
</p>

<p>
He was sobered in an instant.
</p>

<p>
But what could he do?  To continue this
scene was impossible; yet to undeceive her, to
tell her that he loved her not!  what man
could do that?
</p>

<p>
"Why are you so silent?"
</p>

<p>
"I suffer horribly."
</p>

<p>
"From what?"
</p>

<p>
He beat his brow distractedly.
</p>

<p>
"Hester, .... you will curse me.....  It
is not my fault.....  You ...."
</p>

<p>
"Do you not love me?" she almost shrieked.
</p>

<p>
"I do, I do!" he hurriedly exclaimed; "yes,
Hester, I love you .... but .... how shall I
tell it you? .... We must forget this .... we
must meet no more...."
</p>

<p>
"Not meet, when you love me?  Impossible!
The whole world shall not separate us."
</p>

<p>
"It is the world which will separate us."
</p>

<p>
"What .... your wife!" she said scornfully,
almost savagely.
</p>

<p>
"Alas!"
</p>

<p>
"I recognise no barrier in a wife.  I scorn
the whole system of marriage.....  It is
iniquitous!  Two hearts that love to be separated
by a sophism of convention!  If you love <i>her</i>,
keep to her.  If you love <i>me</i>, you are
mine."  Hester rose from the sofa as she spoke: her
whole frame trembled with passion.
</p>

<p>
Cecil remained seated; his eyes fixed on the
ground, in a helpless state of irresolution.
</p>

<p>
"Cecil, one word&mdash;and but one.  Are you
afraid of the idle gossip of the world, and are
your instincts cowed at it?"
</p>

<p>
"Hester!  I feel, Hester, we must part for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Then you love me not?"
</p>

<p>
He did not answer.
</p>

<p>
A loud knocking at the street door startled
them.  She ran to the window, and looked
out.
</p>

<p>
"It is Sir Chetsom.  Cecil, this instant must
decide my fate.  Do you reject my love?"
</p>

<p>
"Believe me, this is a situation&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>He</i> is coming up stairs.  One word&mdash;yes,
or no?"
</p>

<p>
He twirled his hat, and sought for an expression
which should soften the blow, but could
find none.  She looked at him with intense
eagerness, and reading in his hesitation her
worst fears, gave a low heart-breaking sob, and
rushed into the other room.  In a few seconds
the door opened, and the servant announced,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sir Chetsom Chetsom."
</p>

<p>
Cecil brushed past him with a hurried bow,
and made a precipitate retreat.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is all this?" muttered the
astonished baronet.  "Hester not here!"
</p>

<p>
Hester's maid appeared, and informed him
that her mistress would be down immediately,
if he would only be good enough to wait.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your mistress, then?"
</p>

<p>
"In her dressing-room, Sir Chetsom."
</p>

<p>
Without saying another word, Sir Chetsom,
to the horror of the maid, recovered the speed
of his youth to ascend the stairs, and to rush
into the dressing-room.  On all ordinary
occasions he preserved <i>les convenances</i> with great
punctilio; but he was at this moment in an
exasperation of jealousy, and only thought of
clearing up his doubts.  Cecil's exit, and
Hester's absence, were alone startling
circumstances; but when to these be added the
jealousy which for a long time Sir Chetsom had
felt towards Cecil, his exasperation may be
conceived.
</p>

<p>
He found Hester extended on a couch, bathed
in tears.  She rose angrily at his approach, and
with a gesture of great dignity pointed to the
door.  As he seemed noways disposed to obey
her, she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I would be alone .... alone, Sir Chetsom."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Hester, what is all this?  In
tears! what has distressed you?"
</p>

<p>
Her only answer was to pass into her bedroom,
and lock herself in.
</p>

<p>
Sir Chetsom felt foolish.  He tapped at the
door; but she gave no answer.
</p>

<p>
He threatened to break it open; but she
remained silent.
</p>

<p>
He then began to wheedle and entreat, to
threaten, to promise, to storm, and to implore,
alternately.  All in vain: not a word could he
extort from her.
</p>

<p>
He went down into the drawing-room, there
to await her pleasure; sulky and suspicious,
angry yet anxious.
</p>

<p>
Hester, meanwhile, gave full scope to the
paroxysm of her grief.  In Cecil's manner, she
had read her condemnation.  She understood his
momentary aberration.  She saw that although
he had not been able to withstand the excitement
of that moment, yet it was not his heart,
but his senses she had captivated.  She saw
that he loved his wife!
</p>

<p>
Fierce were the convulsions into which this
conviction threw her, and many were the tears
she shed; but after an hour's misery she grew
calmer, and began to think of her condition.
</p>

<p>
Sir Chetsom was below, awaiting her.  He
was jealous; he was angry.  He was ready to
quarrel with her, and she felt that a good
quarrel was just the thing she wanted.
</p>

<p>
Prepared, therefore, for a "scene," she
descended into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! at last," said Sir Chetsom, coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Chetsom, at last.  I presume I
may choose my own time for seeing my visitors;
those who do me the honour of calling upon me
will be pleased to accept that condition, or else
be pleased to stay away."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, madam!" replied he, greatly astonished
at her tone, and foreseeing that she was
ready to burst forth at a word.
</p>

<p>
"So it is, Sir Chetsom.  In which class am I
to place you?"
</p>

<p>
"Hester, I don't understand this language."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will say good-morning.  I dislike
talking to those who do not comprehend me."
</p>

<p>
She rose and moved towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"Hester!  Hester!"
</p>

<p>
She turned round again.
</p>

<p>
"Stay a moment.&mdash;Sit down again.  There,
now let us talk over matters quietly."
</p>

<p>
"Begin.  What have you to say?"
</p>

<p>
"I found you in tears just now."
</p>

<p>
"You did; what then?"
</p>

<p>
She said this so angrily, that he was forced
to pause a moment, and change his tone to say,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I wish&mdash;as a friend&mdash;my love prompts me
to ask the cause of those tears?"
</p>

<p>
"Wretchedness!"
</p>

<p>
"You wretched?"
</p>

<p>
"Intensely!"
</p>

<p>
"My poor Hester!  What has occurred?&mdash;Is
Mr. Chamberlayne&mdash;has he anything to do
with it?"
</p>

<p>
She made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Answer me, dear girl.  Do.  I have a right
to know."
</p>

<p>
She continued silent.
</p>

<p>
"I insist upon knowing."
</p>

<p>
"Insist then," she replied, quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I do insist!" he said, raising his voice.
</p>

<p>
"But your insistance is useless."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  Hester, do not go too far&mdash;Remember&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?  <i>What</i> am I to remember?"
</p>

<p>
"That you&mdash;that I may enforce&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
An ironical laugh was her answer.
</p>

<p>
"Hester, you forget&mdash;I am here as your
protector&mdash;you owe everything to me.&mdash;Be
careful, I am willing to overlook a great
deal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Are you willing to quit the room?" she
said, her eyes flashing as she spoke.  "There
is the door.  May you never enter it again!
Go!  I command you!  <i>You</i> insist&mdash;<i>you</i>
enforce?  And do you imagine that I am to give
up my youth and beauty to age and folly&mdash;that
I am to sacrifice myself, and to such as
you, and then to be told that <i>you</i> insist!
Undeceive yourself, Sir Chetsom.  I am my
own mistress.  I follow my own caprices.  My
caprice once was to live with you.  Now my
caprice is to show you the door.  Go!  I owe
you nothing.  I have not sold myself.  I have
not bound myself.  Go!&mdash;Why do you stand
there gaping at me&mdash;do you not comprehend
my words? or do you fancy that it is
something so strange I should wish never to see
you again?  You imagine, perhaps, that I am
not calm now, that I am unaware of what I do
in relinquishing the protection of Sir Chetsom
Chetsom?  Undeceive yourself.  If I am
angry, I know perfectly what I do.  I know the
<i>extent</i> of my folly&mdash;shall I tell you what it is?
It is that I ever listened to you!  It is that I
ever sullied my name by accepting your
protection!  <i>Now</i>, do you understand me?"
</p>

<p>
She sank in a chair, exhausted.  Poor Sir
Chetsom was troubled and confused.  The
scorn of her manner which lent such momentum
to her words, quite crushed the feeling of
anger which continually rose within him.  She
had often threatened to quit him; but never in
such terms, and never seemed so earnest.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Hester," he said, submissively,
taking a seat near her, "you have misunderstood me."
</p>

<p>
"I do not wish to understand you then."
</p>

<p>
"But are you serious?&mdash;do you wish to leave me?"
</p>

<p>
"Very serious."
</p>

<p>
"But what have I done?  I am sure my life
is spent in trying to make you happy.  Every
wish of yours, as soon as it is expressed, I
endeavour to gratify."
</p>

<p>
"Then my wish is never to see you again;
gratify that!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Hester, be reasonable!  You are
angry now&mdash;I don't know wherefore&mdash;I won't
inquire, if it displeases you&mdash;but you will get
over this to-morrow, you will have forgotten it.
To-morrow I will come and see you."
</p>

<p>
"I will not see you; so spare yourself the
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Not see me!  Is everything over then
between us?  Is this your calm decision?"
</p>

<p>
"It is.  I have told you so before.  What
makes you doubt it?  Do you suppose your
society is so fascinating that I cannot relinquish
it?  Try me!"
</p>

<p>
"I will," said Sir Chetsom, buttoning his
coat, and rising in concentrated anger.
</p>

<p>
"Do so."
</p>

<p>
"You will repent this.  You force me to it,
recollect!  You force me!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning!"
</p>

<p>
"I am not joking, I am serious now."
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning."
</p>

<p>
"If I once quit this house it will be never to
return."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Chetsom I have the pleasure of wishing
you <i>good-morning</i>!"
</p>

<p>
There was no replying to the cutting coolness
of her manner.  He took up his hat, buttoned
his coat up to the chin, fidgeted his gloves,
and at last making an effort, said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Very well, very well!" and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Hester felt considerably relieved.  She had
taken a savage pleasure in this contest, and
utterly reckless of consequences, found in that
very recklessness a satisfaction, which helped
to console her mortified vanity and wounded
affection.  Towards Cecil, she felt hate and
scorn; towards Sir Chetsom, contemptuous
anger, she knew not why.  She had played her
whole existence in that quarrel; and knew that
she was a beggar without a moment's anxiety.
</p>

<p>
The next Day, Sir Chetsom sent her a note,
in which he deplored what had passed between
them, but was willing to attribute it to some
extraordinary irritation; and he moreover offered
to settle six hundred a year upon her for her life,
if she would only consent to remain his friend
as heretofore.
</p>

<p>
The irritation in Hester's mind had not
abated, and she returned this laconic answer:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"CADOGAN PLACE, 13<i>th June</i> 1841.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Not for six thousand.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"H. M."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sir Chetsom was alarmed.  The idea of her
quitting him was more than he could endure.
Completely fascinated by her, the more he
knew of her, the more hopelessly he became
her slave.  He could not imagine living
without her.
</p>

<p>
He called; was refused admittance; called
again; was refused again; wrote, and received
back his letter unopened.
</p>

<p>
He was in despair.  So great was his
preoccupation, that he actually went out with his
whiskers unoiled and undyed!  Hester's servant
at length took pity on his sorrow, and
consented to let him enter the house, against
her orders.
</p>

<p>
He stole up to her boudoir, and throwing
himself at her feet, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hester, I cannot exist without you."
</p>

<p>
"But I can without you," she said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"You smile; then I am forgiven."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but I keep to my resolution."
</p>

<p>
"Hester, hear me out; if, after what I have
to say, you still keep your resolution, I shall
have nothing to do but to leave you in peace.
Here, then, I offer you my hand&mdash;be Lady
Chetsom, and make me happy."
</p>

<p>
At that moment a strange image rose in
Hester's mind.  She had that afternoon met
Cecil driving in the Park.  He raised his hat
in cold politeness, but made no attempt to
speak to her.  The recollection of this scene
now presented itself, as the sort of background
to Sir Chetsom on his knees offering
a title, offering wealth, offering consideration
to the friendless, forsaken, ambitious girl.
</p>

<p>
"Will you accept me?" again whispered
Sir Chetsom.
</p>

<p>
"I shall plague your life out," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Then that is a settled matter!"
</p>

<p>
Sir Chetsom was the happiest of men.
</p>

<p>
But his happiness only lasted a fortnight,
and was then suddenly cut short by that
inflexible lady&mdash;Atropos.  Driving home one
evening, his horse shied at something in the
road, and ran away with him down Constitution
Hill, then stumbled and threw Sir Chetsom
against the railings.  A concussion of the
brain was the consequence.
</p>

<p>
By this accident, Hester not only lost the
honour of becoming Lady Chetsom, but she
was absolutely left penniless, as Sir Chetsom
died intestate.
</p>

<p>
To this had her ambition brought her!  With
no resources, with no <i>friends</i>, without even a
good name, she had to begin the world anew.
Literature was the desperate resource which
alone awaited her; and she resolved to live
by her pen.

BOOK VII.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
GEORGE MAXWELL.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>Pietro.</i>&mdash;"This Malevole is one of the most prodigious
affectations that ever conversed with nature.  A man, or rather
a monster: more discontent than Lucifer, when he was thrust
out of the Presence.  His appetite is as insatiable as the grave:
as far from any content as from heaven."
</p>

<p class="intro">
JOHN MARSTON.&mdash;<i>The Malcontent.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner was radiant again;
if not happy, she was at least sprightly,
occupied, and flattered.  She had not forgotten
Marmaduke, she had not forgiven him; but
although his image sometimes lowered upon
her, she banished it with a smile of triumph,
for she was loved!
</p>

<p>
The silent, shy, and saturnine George Maxwell
had taken Marmaduke's place, as <i>cavalier
servente</i>; and across his dark, forbidding face
there shone a gleam of sunshine, as he now
watched the sylph-like enchantress, who for
so long had made him more and more misanthropical
by her gay indifference to him, and
who at last had perceived his love.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke, his hated favoured rival, was
dismissed; and not only was a rival dismissed,
but he, George, was admitted in his place.
</p>

<p>
The history of these two may be told in a
few words.  Maxwell, silent and watchful so
long as Marmaduke was a visitor at the house,
suddenly became more talkative and
demonstrative when he found Marmaduke's visits
cease.  Hopes rose within him.  He spoke
with another accent, and with other looks to
Mrs. Vyner.  She was not long in understanding
him.  Once opening her eyes to his love,
she saw as in a flash of light, the whole history
of his passion, she understood the conduct of the
silent, jealous lover, and deeply flattered at such
constancy and unencouraged affection, began
to turn a favourable eye upon him.  Smarting
herself from wounded affection, she could the
more readily and truly sympathize with him.
In a few weeks&mdash;for passion grows with strange
rapidity, and days are epochs in its history&mdash;she
gave him to understand that he was not
<i>indifferent</i> to her.  Of Marmaduke she spoke
freely to him, telling him the same story she
had told her husband; and he believed her:
what will not lovers believe!
</p>

<p>
No word of love as yet had passed their lips,
and yet they understood each other.  Indeed,
so plain was the avowal of her looks, that a
man less shy and suspicious than Maxwell
would long ago have declared his passion,
certain of a return.  But he was withheld by
the very fierceness of his passion, and by his
horror at ridicule.  Maxwell was one of those
men who never enter the water till they can
swim&mdash;who never undertake anything till they
are certain of succeeding, held back by the fear
of failure.  One trait in his character will set
this disposition clearly forth: he had a fine
tenor voice, and sang with some mastery, but
he never could be prevailed upon to sing before
any one, except his family, because he was
waiting till he could execute as well as Rubini
or Mario.  Meanwhile, he was intensely jealous
of those who, not having reached that standard,
<i>did</i> sing; and his scornful criticisms on their
curious presumption, was nothing but miserable
spite at their not having so sensitive a vanity
as his own.
</p>

<p>
Maxwell was in truth a bad, mean-spirited,
envious, passionate man, in whom vanity,
ludicrously susceptible and exacting, fostered
the worst of passions, jealousy and revenge.
He was misanthropical: not because his own
high-thoughted soul turned from the pettiness
of mankind with intolerant disgust,&mdash;not
because he had pryed too curiously into the
corruptions of human nature, without at the same
time having been fortunate enough to know
familiarly all that is great, and loving, and
noble in the human heart&mdash;but simply because
his life was a perpetual demand upon the
abnegation, affection, and admiration of others, and
because that demand could not, in the nature
of things, be satisfied.  It has been said that a
man who affects misanthropy is a coxcomb, for
real misanthropy is madness.  Not always
madness: seldom so; it is generally inordinate and
unsatisfied vanity.  A man hates his fellow-creatures
because they, unwittingly, are always
irritating him by refusing to submit to the
exactions of his vanity: he construes their neglect
into insult, their indifference into envy.  He
envies them for succeeding where he dare not
venture; he hates them for not acknowledging
his own standard of himself.  Maxwell was one
of these.
</p>

<p>
Conceive such a man suddenly caught in the
meshes of a brilliant coquette like Mrs. Meredith
Vyner!  Conceive him after two years of
angry expectation, during which she has never
bestowed a smile on him which was not
unmeaning, now awakening to the conviction that
his merits are recognised, that his love is
returned, that he has inspired a guilty passion!
</p>

<p>
The guilt added intensity to his joy: it was
so immense a triumph!
</p>

<p>
What a pair!  Love has been well said to
delight in antitheses, otherwise we might stare
at the contrast afforded by this little,
hump-backed, golden-haired, coquettish, heartless
woman, and this saturnine, gloomy, stupid,
bad-hearted man.
</p>

<p>
Poor Meredith Vyner could not comprehend
it.  The evidence of his eyes told him plainly
how the case stood; but his inexperienced mind
refused to accept the evidence of his senses.
What <i>could</i> she see in so grim and uninteresting
an animal?  Marmaduke was quite another
man; affection for him was intelligible at least;
but Maxwell!  And what could Maxwell see
in her?  Why, she was the very contradiction
of all he must feel in his own breast!
</p>

<p>
In that contradiction was the charm: Maxwell
did himself instinctively, but involuntarily,
that justice; he would assuredly have hated a
duplicate of himself, even more intensely than
he hated others.
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner endeavoured once or twice to
come to an "explanation" with his wife; for
he <i>was</i> master in his own house, and <i>would</i> be,
or he was greatly deceived.  But she answered
him with a few galling sarcasms (adding general
allusions to the miseries of young wives subject
to the absurd jealousies of foolish, old men), and
ending in&mdash;hysterics!  There was no combating
hysterics, and Vyner was always defeated.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0702"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
ROSE AGAIN SEES JULIUS.
</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner again went into society as usual,
the only difference being that she was
generally accompanied by Maxwell instead of her
husband.  Rose often stayed at home, but
sometimes went with her.  Time had not made
her forget Julius St. John, but it had brought
back the elasticity of her spirits; and except
an occasional sigh of regret, or a short reverie,
she was much the same as she had been before.
</p>

<p>
One Saturday on which they went to
Dr. Whiston's soirée, Rose accompanied them, and
was delighted to see Cecil there in high spirits,
and beautifully dressed.  Blanche's condition of
course prevented her being there.
</p>

<p>
"But she is quite well, is she not?"
</p>

<p>
"Charming, and looks lovelier than ever."
</p>

<p>
"I have not been to see her this week.
Mama has not been able to let me have the
carriage.  How gets on your new picture?"
</p>

<p>
"Famously.  How beautiful you are looking
to-night, Rose!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am; do I ever fail?  But tell
me, what is the subject of your picture?"
</p>

<p>
He put his finger on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"That's a secret.  I let none know anything
about it, as I intend surprising you all."
</p>

<p>
"Papa is so proud of you now, that I think
if you were to go to him, all would be made
up."
</p>

<p>
"That's kind, certainly; now I no longer
need him, he is willing to acknowledge his
son-in-law.  No, Rosy, no; I have made advances
enough; <i>he</i> must make them now."
</p>

<p>
"But think how delightful it would be for us
all!"
</p>

<p>
"I know that; besides, I know it must come.
He will make the first advance; and he <i>shall</i>
make it."
</p>

<p>
The secret of Cecil's holding back was not
pride, but calculation.  He fancied that if Vyner
made the first advances to him, he could <i>make
terms</i>; and his recent losses at the gaming-table
had made him sensible of the precariousness of
his present resources.
</p>

<p>
As they moved through the crowd, and were
passing into the second room, they came face to
face with Mrs. St. John and Julius.
</p>

<p>
There was no avoiding a recognition.  Rose
blushed deeply, and felt extremely embarrassed;
but recovering herself, she held out her hand to
Mrs. St. John, who took it coldly.
</p>

<p>
Cecil and Julius shook hands cordially.
</p>

<p>
"Have you long been returned?" asked Rose
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Six weeks," was the laconic reply.  "I hope
Mr. Vyner is quite well, and Mrs. Vyner?'
</p>

<p>
"Mama is here&mdash;in the other room," she
said, with an effort.
</p>

<p>
She made a movement as if to pass on; her
eye met Julius's as she bowed, but his face,
though deadly pale, gave no sign of agitation.
</p>

<p>
In another instant, they were in the next
room; and Rose, with well acted indifference,
occupied herself with the specimens exhibited
on the table, addressing common-place remarks
to Cecil, much to his astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Is it all over, then, Rose?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"All.  Oh, do look at this machine for teaching
the blind to write&mdash;how very curious."
</p>

<p>
"Are you serious, Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"Serious!  Didn't you see the cut direct?"
</p>

<p>
"You take it calmly!"
</p>

<p>
"Would you have a scene?  Shall I faint?
Shall I pretend to be stabbed to the heart?
Shall I act a part?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretend!  Are you not acting now?"
</p>

<p>
"Not I.  If you think their reception has
pained me, pray undeceive yourself; it is no
more than I expected.  Months ago I made up
my mind.  I know what to think of <i>him</i>.  I am
glad he has behaved so; very glad, very glad.
It now puts everything beyond a doubt.  Very
glad."
</p>

<p>
She muttered "very glad" to herself as she
sat down in a chair just left by a dowager, and
tried to cheat herself into the belief that she
really was glad.  In truth, she was at that
moment more indignant than unhappy.  The
coldness of her reception, both by mother and son,
had exasperated her.  Had he looked pleased
to see her, had he even looked very pained, she
would have at once given him to understand
that his retreat had been precipitate, and that
she was ready to accept him with delight.  But
his coldness piqued her; she refrained from
addressing a word to him; and was now
indulging in somewhat bitter reflections on his
conduct.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Mrs. Vyner had been eloquent in
her admiration of Cecil and his genius, to Lady
F&mdash;&mdash;, with whom she was talking.  Maxwell,
from time to time, threw in a sarcasm, and was
evidently uneasy at hearing any one praised so
highly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but you know, my dear sir," said
Lady F&mdash;&mdash;, "he must be monstrous clever, or
he would never make so much money."
</p>

<p>
Maxwell shrugged his shoulders, and said,
with considerable significance in the tone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That depends upon how he makes it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner looked at him surprised.  A
little while afterwards, when they were standing
retired apart from the company, she asked
him what he meant by his reply to Lady F&mdash;&mdash;,
respecting Cecil's money-making.
</p>

<p>
"I mean this: he doesn't make money by
his <i>genius</i>," Maxwell replied, with sneering
emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"By what, then?"
</p>

<p>
Maxwell refused at first to answer.
</p>

<p>
"What can you be hinting at?  By what
means does he make his money?"
</p>

<p>
"By ... there, I may as well tell you;
you must soon hear it ... by gambling."
</p>

<p>
A shudder of disgust ran over her frame.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure&mdash;quite sure of this?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite: I had it from a man who plays
nightly at the same table with him."
</p>

<p>
"How horrible! isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied, with a sardonic smile:
"it's <i>genius</i>."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him astonished: at that
moment, she hated him.  Well would it have been
for her if she had taken the warning of that
moment, and flung from her the viper that was
crawling to her heart.  But she forgot it.
Maxwell's smile passed away, and was
replaced by one of tenderness for her.
</p>

<p>
Rose and her mother were both thoughtful
as they rode home that night.
</p>

<p>
The next day, Rose communicated to her
father what Cecil had said at Dr. Whiston's,
and begged him to write to Cecil, and
announce his forgiveness.  Vyner, who would
have been well pleased to do so, spoke with
his wife about it.
</p>

<p>
"He is a credit to us now," added Vyner.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes, a <i>great</i> credit."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think so?"
</p>

<p>
"How should I not?  Vyner is an old name&mdash;a
good name&mdash;it can gain no fresh <i>éclat</i>
from honours, but it may from infamy."
</p>

<p>
"From infamy, Mary?"
</p>

<p>
"Cecil Chamberlayne, your creditable son-in-law,
is a gambler."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!"
</p>

<p>
"His cab and tiger, his dinners, his
trinkets&mdash;all come from that infamous source: it is
his means of livelihood."
</p>

<p>
"My poor, poor Blanche!" exclaimed the
wretched father, as the tears came into his
eyes.  "But she shall not stay with him
.... I will take her away ... She shall come to
us .... she shall."
</p>

<p>
In vain his wife interposed; he ordered the
carriage, and drove at once to Cecil's house.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0703"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
WOMAN'S LOVE.
</h3>

<p>
Blanche was trimming a baby cap, when her
father entered the room.  With a cry of delight
she sprang up, and rushed into his arms.  He
hugged her fondly, and the tears rolled down
his cheeks as he pressed his child sadly to his
bosom.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before either of them spoke.
</p>

<p>
"My poor child!" he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"Your happy child, papa; I am so happy!
I knew you would forgive me soon.  Oh! why
is not Cecil here to join with me in gratitude?"
</p>

<p>
"Blanche," he said with an effort, "I am
come to take you away with me: will you
come?"
</p>

<p>
She looked her answer.
</p>

<p>
"That is right, ... that is right .... Pack
up your things, then, at once."
</p>

<p>
"Pack up what things?" she asked in
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you want to take with you .... Come
.... don't stay in this house a moment
longer than you can help."
</p>

<p>
Her astonishment increased.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean me to leave my home?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And .... my husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Leave my husband?&mdash;leave my Cecil?
Why, papa, what can have put that into
your head?  Do you suppose, I am not happy
here? ... He is the best of husbands!"
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner had recourse to his snuff-box,
as in all emergencies.  He inserted thumb
and index finger into it, and trifled mechanically
with the grains, while seeking for some
argument.
</p>

<p>
"Do, dear papa, relieve me from this
suspense .... What is it you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you serious, Blanche?&mdash;<i>is</i> he a good
husband?'
</p>

<p>
"I adore him; he is the kindest creature on
earth."
</p>

<p>
Vyner took a huge pinch.  That did not
clear his ideas, and he sat silently brushing
off the grains which had congregated in the
wrinkles of his waistcoat, very much puzzled
what to say.
</p>

<p>
"Papa, there is something on your mind.
If it is anything against Cecil .... anything
a wife ought not to hear, spare me, and do
not utter it.  If it is anything else, spare me
the suspense, and tell me at once what it is."
</p>

<p>
"Blanche, my dearest child, I came here to
save you from ruin, and I will save you.  You
must quit your husband."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Is not my word sufficient?  I say you
must.  Your welfare depends upon it."
</p>

<p>
"Why?&mdash;I say again&mdash;why?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you&mdash;no, you cannot be aware of <i>how</i>
your husband gains a livelihood."
</p>

<p>
She coloured violently and trembled.  He
noticed it, and read the avowal in her
agitation.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>do</i> know it then?"
</p>

<p>
She burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear child, since you know it,
that saves me an unpleasant explanation.  But
you must leave him; you cannot stay here
longer: you cannot share his infamy; you shall
not be dragged into his ruin.  It has been a
miserable match; I have always grieved over
it; always knew it would end wretchedly.
But to come to this!&mdash;to this!  No, Blanche,
you cannot remain here.  Come and live at
home; there at least you will not live in
infamy."
</p>

<p>
She wept bitterly, but offered no remark.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Blanche," he said, taking her hand,
"you will leave this place, will you not?  You
will live with us.  I cannot promise to make
you happy, but at least I can save you from
the wretched existence of a gambler's wife.
Come&mdash;come."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot!" she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"Rouse yourself: conquer this emotion.
Think of your future&mdash;think of your child!"
</p>

<p>
She shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Think of the child you are to bring into the
world.  Must it also share in the ruin which its
father will inevitably draw upon you?  My
dear Blanche, you must have courage; for
your own sake&mdash;for your child's sake&mdash;you
must quit this house.  Come home to me.  I
am unhappy myself; I want to have some one
about me I can love: Rose is the only one:
Violet is away: your mother&mdash;but don't let me
speak of her.  You see, Blanche, dear, I want
you; you will fill a place at home; you will be
so petted; and the little one will have every
comfort&mdash;and his aunt Rose&mdash;but don't sob so,
my child: do restrain yourself.  You will come, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot!"
</p>

<p>
Vyner took another pinch of snuff, and was
disconcerted; there was such wretchedness, but
such resolution in her tone, that he felt his
arguments had been powerless.
</p>

<p>
Her sobs were pitiful to hear, and his own
eyes were filled with tears, in spite of his rising
anger at what he considered her obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
"Why can you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he is my husband&mdash;one whom I
have chosen for better for worse, for richer for
poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, to
cherish, and to obey, till death do us part&mdash;one
from whom death alone shall part me, for I
love him, he loves me, and by his side I can
smilingly await poverty, even ruin."
</p>

<p>
"Even infamy!" exclaimed Vyner.
</p>

<p>
"Even infamy!" she replied, in a low sad tone.
</p>

<p>
"This is madness."
</p>

<p>
"It is love&mdash;it is duty.  I know the wretched
fate which must befall us.  I foresee it: but if
it had already fallen, I should say the same.
I cannot leave him!  I may be miserable; we
may be brought to beggary; my child may
want every necessary&mdash;oh!  I have not shut my
eyes to <i>that</i> terrible prospect!  I have seen it;
it has wrung my heart, but I cannot&mdash;would
not, if I could&mdash;leave him who is all my
happiness.  Cecil is more than my husband: he is
all that I hold dearest in life: he is the father
of that child whose future you so gloomily
foresee; shall that child&mdash;shall <i>my</i> child not
smile upon its father?  You do not know what
you ask."
</p>

<p>
"I ask you to be happy."
</p>

<p>
"I am so.  Without Cecil I could not be so.
Let misfortune come to me in any shape, so
that it rob me not of him, and I can bear it;
only not that&mdash;only not that!"
</p>

<p>
"Bless you for those words, my own beloved!"
said a voice which made them both start and
look up.
</p>

<p>
Cecil stood before them.  He had overheard
the greater part of their conversation, and had
opened the door without their noticing it,
absorbed as they were in their own emotions.
</p>

<p>
Vyner took three rapid pinches, and felt
greatly confused.  Blanche threw herself into
her husband's arms, and sobbed aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, my own Blanche, for the unshaken
depth of your love.  It shall not be
thrown away.  I will no longer be unworthy
of it.  I have been a villain&mdash;yes, sir, I confess
I have been a weak and selfish villain; seduced
by my necessities, and by vile temptations, I
have nearly brought this dear girl to ruin.  But
this morning has saved me.  I have seen the
peril&mdash;I will&mdash;hear me, sir, solemnly swear, by
all that is sacred&mdash;by all my hopes of happiness&mdash;by
this dear head now resting on my heart&mdash;I
swear never again, on any pretext, to touch a
card&mdash;to enter a house of play!  Will you
believe me?  You hear my oath&mdash;a gentleman's
word ought to be sufficient, but you have my
oath&mdash;will you believe it?"
</p>

<p>
Blanche pressed him convulsively to her, and
laughed hysterically in her joy.
</p>

<p>
Vyner rose, and taking Cecil's hand, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Chamberlayne, you are a man of honour; I
respect you.  What you have now done effaces
the past.  We are reconciled.  I will assure
you two hundred pounds a year during my life,
which, with your own income, will suffice, I
hope, to keep you in decent comfort, and will
enable you to employ your talents honourably,
and, I hope, profitably.  My house is open to
you.  We are reconciled, are we not?"
</p>

<p>
Cecil pressed his hand warmly.
</p>

<p>
"I have been angry with you," Vyner
continued, "but my anger is gone&mdash;what says
our favourite?"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Non Dindymene, non adytis quatit<br>
  Mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius<br>
  Non Liber æque, non acuta<br>
  Si geminant Corybantes æra<br>
  Tristes ut iræ&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Eh? is it not so?  The past then is forgotten?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir," said Cecil, wiping away a tear,
"I do not deserve such kindness....  I have
been a wretch....  But my future conduct shall
thank you&mdash;I cannot now!"
</p>

<p>
"All I ask is&mdash;make Blanche happy."
</p>

<p>
Cecil looked down upon her upturned face,
and met her loving glance with a look of
unutterable tenderness; then drawing her head
to him, he pressed his lips upon her eyes; she
threw her arms around him, and exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"How can I help being happy with him?"
</p>

<p>
Much affected by this scene, Vyner again
pressed Cecil's hand with great warmth, kissed
his child, wiped his eyes, and withdrew; for his
heart was full.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
A BEAM OF SUNSHINE IN THE HOUSE.
</h3>

<p>
Cecil was very earnest in his repentance, and
sincerely meant to keep the oath he pledged.
He at once sold his cab and horse; discharged
his tiger; reduced his expenses in every
practicable way; paid the great bulk of his debts;
ceased to visit the club; ordered the servant
to deny him to Frank Forrester, whenever
that worthy called; and was assiduous at his
painting.
</p>

<p>
Having thus shut himself out from temptation,
and begun again the career of an honourable
man, he ought once more to have been
happy.  He was so for a few days.  Blanche's
recovered gaiety, and her grateful fondness,
made him bless the change.  But the excitement
soon wore off; and in getting into the
broad monotonous rut of daily life, he began to
miss the variety and excitement of his former
pursuits.
</p>

<p>
He could not work with pleasure: he had
lost all the "delight" which "physics
pain."  Work to him was drudgery, and it was no
more.  His spirits became low.  From Blanche
he hid the change as well as he could; but he
could not hide it from himself.  He would
stand for half an hour before his easel, absorbed
in reveries, and not once putting pencil to the
canvass.  He would sit for hours in an easy
chair, smoking, or affecting to read; but his
mind incessantly occupied playing imaginary
games at <i>rouge et noir</i>, in which he was
invariably a winner.
</p>

<p>
There is this excuse for the gambler: the
temptation besets him in a more powerful
shape than almost any other temptation to
which man is exposed.  Imagination, stimulated
by cupidity, is treacherously active.  The
games being games of chance, imagination
plays them not only with alarming distinctness,
but with most delusive success.  Heaps of
gold glitter before the infatuated dreamer; and
although he rouses himself with a sigh to find
that he has only been dreaming, yet the dream
has had the vividness of reality to him.  Many
and many an unhappy wight has started up
from such dreams, goaded with a sense of their
reality, and persuaded that, if he only play the
game as he has just played it in imagination,
he must infallibly win; has pawned his last
remnant, or robbed his employers, to rush to
the gaming-table, and venture everything on
the strength of that conviction.  Ruined,
perhaps dishonoured, people have exclaimed, The
wretch! or The scoundrel! and have been stern
in their indignant condemnation of his pitiable
folly.  But little do they know to what fearful
temptations he has succumbed; little do they
know the <i>fascination</i> of the gaming-table to
one who has played much, and whose hours
have been crowded with imaginary games, in
which he has been eminently successful.
</p>

<p>
I do not defend the gambler: God forbid!
I am merely endeavouring to present a
psychological explanation of the very common
phenomenon, which people generally regard
as produced only by some innate wickedness.
The gambler knows the folly of his act: no one
so well!  He knows that the bank must win,
and in his cooler moments will demonstrate the
matter clearly to you.  But then comes this
seductive imagination, like a syren, picturing
to him gorgeous realities: he is dazzled,
fascinated, and succumbs.
</p>

<p>
To resist imagination, to trample down temptation,
a man needs strength of will; but this is
precisely the quality men are most deficient in;
and here, as almost everywhere, we find that
vice is not, as Plato says, ignorance, but
weakness!
</p>

<p>
Cecil held out manfully against temptation,
and everyone believed him cured.  No one knew
what was constantly passing in his mind, or
they would not have been so secure.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Blanche had passed safely
through her blissful trial, and a little girl was
nestled at her side.  The joy and rapture of
the happy parents, the delight of Rose, the
pride of Vyner, and the supreme indifference of
Mrs. Vyner, may well be conceived.  Little
Rose Blanche, that was her name, was more
welcomed, and more caressed than if she had
come into the world to preserve great estates
from passing into other hands; and how she
escaped being killed by the excess of attention
and variety of advice, is only another illustration
of the mysterious escapes of infancy: a
period when it would seem some good genii
must be always on the alert to prevent the ever
imminent catastrophe.  There is said to be a
special god who looks after drunkards, and
preserves them in their helpless state; but what
are the perils of a drunkard to the perils of an
infant surrounded with nurses, relations, and
female friends?
</p>

<p>
Rose Blanche throve, however, and grew
into a dimply, rosy babe enough, incomparably
more beautiful than any other babe ever seen,
as mother, father, nurse, and aunt incessantly
testified.  It did squall a little, to be sure, and
Cecil who had irritable nerves could not be
brought to consider that musical.  But men! what
do they know of babies?
</p>

<p>
My dear madam, answer me frankly, did
you ever know a man who was worth listening
to on that subject?  Did you ever meet with
one whose head was not crammed with absurd
notions thereupon?  Is not your husband, in
particular, characterized by the most preposterous
incapacity&mdash;is he not fidgety, crotchety,
absurd?  I knew it.
</p>

<p>
Let me not, therefore, admit one word of
Cecil's respecting Rose Blanche, who promised
to have more beauty, intelligence, and heart,
than any other infant then sprawling in long
clothes, or then looking with profound impenetrable
calmness upon the wondrous universe to
which it had been so recently introduced.
</p>

<p>
A beam of sunshine had been let into the
existence of Blanche and Cecil, a beam which
stretching far out into the future gilded the
distant horizon, so that they, and all,
pronounced great happiness in store for them.
The exquisite expression of maternal love made
Blanche incomparably beautiful; and Cecil, as
he watched her gazing downwards on the
infant at her breast, in that deep stillness of
seraphic love, whose calm intensity Raphael,
alone has succeeded in pourtraying,&mdash;would
bend forward and press his lips upon her forehead
chastened, purified, and exalted.  In those
moments he was another man; ennui fled,
discouragement was conquered, and the cards
were not before his mind's eye.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
DEAREST MARMADUKE,
</p>

<p>
I must write to you.  I have been on
the point of doing so often, very often, and
now I learn from Rose that you have written
to ask her if she could send you news of
my health from time to time.  Thank you,
Marmaduke, thank you for the delicacy
which has dictated your respect for my
resolution&mdash;thank you for not having
attempted to discover my retreat.  You see I
disclose it to you now&mdash;I am with my kind
old uncle&mdash;I let you know it, confiding in your
not abusing the knowledge, and attempting to
see me.  We cannot meet.  I could not endure
it.  But we can write.  Your letters will be a
solace to me; to write to you will be an
exquisite pleasure.  Yes, Marmaduke, I long to
pour out my soul to you; I long to tell you all
I think, all I do; and you will tell me what
you think, and what you do, will you not?
There is no issue from our fate; we must
bear it, but we shall bear it with less
murmuring if we can speak to each other without
reserve.
</p>

<p>
"My health, you will be glad to learn, is
good.  Exercise keeps up my strength, in spite
of what I have suffered.  I am almost all day
on horseback with my uncle, and that keeps
me strong.  Shot is of course my inseparable
companion; the dear beast sympathizes with
me, I am sure; and sometimes when I sit still,
my soul carried away in some sad reverie, I
see his intelligent eyes fixed inquiringly on my
face, and then I say, 'where is Marmaduke?'
and he pricks his ears, wags his tail, and runs
to the door to listen if indeed you are coming;
disappointed, he returns to his place to look
sadly at me, as if he knew that your presence
alone would bring the smile again upon my
face.
</p>

<p>
"I am much calmer than I was.  Renewed
health has doubtless a great deal to do with it,
for misery is but malady; the healthy are not
long unhappy.  I now resign myself to the
inevitable, and no longer beat my distracted
wings against my cage.  Happy I am not, and
cannot hope to be; but I am calm, and in my
calmness it seems to me that the privilege of
writing to you, and of knowing that you think
of me, is a privilege which the happiest might
envy.
</p>

<p>
"I read much.  Tell me what books you are
reading that I may read them too, and so be
with you in spirit, even in your studies.  Mind
you obey me in this particular, and tell me all
the books you read.  Do not be afraid of
frightening me by the dryness of the subject.
I have been a miscellaneous and unwomanly
reader.  Papa's and uncle's libraries have
always been at my disposal, and although I
have studied no one subject, and am
consequently very, very ignorant, yet in my
unrestrained liberty I have read all sorts of books,
from treatises of philosophy to novels.  You
know papa made us all learn a little Latin,
that he might explain Horace to us; so that I
have got a tincture of learning, just enough to
make men's books intelligible, and not enough
to make me a blue.
</p>

<p>
"Therefore, let me read what you read; I
shall, perhaps, understand a serious book all the
better from knowing that you have understood
it; for I want my mind to be as little below
your level as culture can make it.
</p>

<p>
"Describe to me your daily habits and
avocations.  Rose tells me that you are seen
nowhere; that you have ceased to visit all your
old friends.  What replaces them?
</p>

<p>
"I do not ask you if you think of me.  I
know you do.  My own heart tells me so.  I
know your character; with all its manly
strength, it has womanly tenderness in it, like
the honey Samson found in the lion's mouth;
and that tenderness is my guarantee that I am
not forgotten; that, although separated by an
insuperable barrier, we are not less united in
heart.  You will not cease to love me because
I cannot be yours; you will not love me less
because I am forced to deny you.  No, Marmaduke,
love such as yours is not selfish: it is
something higher than self, and I will not pay
you the ill compliment of doubting it.  Could
I do so, I should be selfish enough to appeal to
your feelings, to entreat you to love me ever,
and not to think of another.  I should be
jealous could I doubt you&mdash;but I cannot
doubt.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, Marmaduke, may you be
happy!  Write to me soon; and write only of
yourself.

CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
BRIGHTER SCENES.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  You o'erjoyed spirits, wipe your long-wet eyes!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOHN MARSTON.&mdash;<i>The Malcontent.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a charming ball at Mrs. Langley
Turner's.  The rooms were full without being
crowded, and the company was brilliant: rank,
beauty, and talent, gave their éclat to the
scene.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner and Rose were there;
George Maxwell of course, and to Rose's
extreme delight, Julius St. John.  She was at
first annoyed at recognising him, but her second
thoughts showed her that the present was an
excellent opportunity for exhibiting her
indifference.  She was, accordingly, in high spirits,
or seemed to be so; accepted the homage paid
her with saucy coquetry; danced, talked, and
laughed as if her heart were as light as
innocence could make it.  A careless bow had been
her only salute of Julius, and she passed by
him several times without affecting not to
observe him.
</p>

<p>
She noticed that he had grown thinner and
paler.  His face had grown more thoughtful,
but his demeanour was perfectly calm.
</p>

<p>
Late in the evening, Rose was examining the
flowers, and thinking of the handsome young
guardsman who had just left her side, when
she felt some one approach her.  It was Julius.
She resumed her inspection of the flowers.
</p>

<p>
"If you are not engaged for the next
quadrille, Miss Vyner," he said in a low but firm
tone, "may I hope for the honour?"
</p>

<p>
"I am engaged," she replied quietly, and
then moved half-way round the flower-stand, as
if to discover fresh beauties.
</p>

<p>
Julius did not mistake the refusal; but he
was not to be so easily discouraged.
</p>

<p>
"Are you also engaged for the quadrille after
that?"
</p>

<p>
"I am."
</p>

<p>
There was less firmness in her tone; he
thought it trembled.
</p>

<p>
"And .... I hope I am not intrusive .... and
the next?"
</p>

<p>
Rose fancied that a refusal would look like
fear, so she mastered her voice, and replied,
with the stereotyped smile,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I shall have much pleasure."
</p>

<p>
He bowed, and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Rose's gaiety was somewhat damped; she
tried to be lively, but there was a depression on
her spirits she could not shake off.  It seemed
as if her eyes could fix themselves nowhere
but in the direction in which Julius stood.
</p>

<p>
She tried to look away, but she soon found
herself again watching him.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Maxwell was remonstrating with
Mrs. Vyner upon the little desire she exhibited
to be near him, to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
"We must think of appearances," she replied;
"here every action is noticed and commented-on."
</p>

<p>
"But other men sit by you; you talk to them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; as a blind.  If I am seen much with
you, people will begin to gossip."
</p>

<p>
"What if they do?" he brutally replied.
</p>

<p>
"What if they do!  Are you indifferent
to it?"
</p>

<p>
"You do not seem to be, at any rate,"
he said, sarcastically.  "You have grown very
respectful of appearances of late.  You never
thought of them with Mr. Ashley."
</p>

<p>
"Because I did not care for him."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>looked</i> as if you did; you acted as
if you did; and every one supposed you did."
</p>

<p>
"But they were wrong.  I was not careful
then, because there was no danger of my
committing myself.  With you, it is very
different."
</p>

<p>
"So it appears."
</p>

<p>
"Now you are angry."
</p>

<p>
"I am."
</p>

<p>
"What about?"
</p>

<p>
"Your indifference."
</p>

<p>
"Foolish fellow!" she said playfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, it is very easy to say that; but
I feel I have cause to be angry.  You pretend
to love me, yet you can leave me here in the
room, and chatter away to any fool who pleases
to accost you.  One would think I was indifferent
to you."
</p>

<p>
"<i>One</i> would think! who would? would you?
What does it matter to you if the world thinks
me indifferent to you?"
</p>

<p>
"It matters a great deal."
</p>

<p>
"How so?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course it does; it always matters to a
man to have a charming woman care for him.
People envy him his good fortune.  They think
more highly of him."
</p>

<p>
"And you wish to be envied?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not wish it to be supposed that I
am so unattractive that no woman can care
for me."
</p>

<p>
"It would please you, then, if people
gossipped about us?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't say that exactly; though I don't
see what harm their gossip could do us."
</p>

<p>
She fixed her grey eyes upon him with a
strange expression.  In an instant she read
his character&mdash;its intense selfishness was
revealed; and she began to doubt whether he,
too, might not be playing with her, as
Marmaduke had played; or worse, whether his
love might not be the mere prompting of a
wretched vanity, which sought her conquest
as a trophy, not as a desire.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Maxwell, we differ so entirely in our
views, that it would be useless to prolong this
discussion.  I have only this more to say: so
far from giving the world any right to gossip
about me, in reference to you, it is my
determination to relinquish the pleasure of your
acquaintance from this time forward.  When
you have learned what is due to me, I may
resume it; not till then."
</p>

<p>
She rose, as she said this, and walked across
the room to Mrs. Langley Turner, by whose
side she sat down; while Maxwell gazed on her
with mingled feelings of astonishment and rage,
his brow darkening, his lips compressed, and
every nerve within him trembling.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner was wrong in her suspicions.  It
was not vanity, it was jealousy which prompted
his words.  He suffered tortures from seeing
her smile, and chat with other men, and
scarcely notice him.  He was sincere in his
wish for her to distinguish him above all the
rest; not simply to gratify his vanity, but to
assure him that she really loved him enough to
brave everything for him.  Besides, he could
not understand how her love allowed her to
keep away from his side.  Prudence never
chilled <i>him</i>.  Appearances never restrained
him.  He could have sat by her all the
evening&mdash;every evening&mdash;it was what he most
desired; and he did not understand how she
could forego the same pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Maxwell was narrow-minded, even stupid;
but his passions were intense; and at this
moment he felt as if he could murder her.
He quitted the ball in a state of deep
concentrated anger, brooding on what he
considered his wrongs.
</p>

<p>
Julius came to claim Rose for the quadrille.
They were silent at first, and embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"How did you like Italy?" she said, by
way of breaking the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed! then you are singular.  I thought
every one must like it.  Perhaps you prefer
contradiction?'
</p>

<p>
"No; I was in no frame of mind to enjoy
anything."
</p>

<p>
She trembled slightly; the <i>chaine des dames</i>,
by obliging her to quit his side, prevented her
speaking.  When they again stood quietly
beside each other, he continued,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We went to see everything, and the only
result was, that we so tired ourselves during
the day, that we slept soundly at night."
</p>

<p>
"But the pictures, the statues, the architecture,
the people?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw them all; but they all wearied me."
</p>

<p>
"You were rehearsing Childe Harold, I
suppose?" she said, with a feeble attempt at
liveliness, which her voice belied.
</p>

<p>
"If I had been acting a part&mdash;even of
misanthropy&mdash;I should have enjoyed myself
unhappily ... It is your <i>l'été</i>."
</p>

<p>
She advanced, and the conversation was
again interrupted.  Nothing more was said
during the rest of the quadrille; both were
absorbed in their own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
He led her to a seat, and took another beside
her.  After a pause of some moments, she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So you were unhappy in Italy?"
</p>

<p>
He looked earnestly into her eyes as he
answered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Does that surprise you?  Were you not
already aware of it?  Had I not cause?"
</p>

<p>
She blushed deeply, as she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No; you had .... no cause .... if you
had stayed in England .... you might have
got over it."
</p>

<p>
His lower jaw fell as she concluded this
phrase.  She felt herself on the eve of a
declaration, and by a strong effort turned it off
in that way.
</p>

<p>
At this moment a partner came to carry her
off for a waltz, and Julius was left to his own
reflections.  He reproached himself for having
so far betrayed his feelings; but in truth they
had been wrung from him, as from her, by the
irresistible fascination of the moment.
</p>

<p>
On closer inspection, it seemed to him, as if
there had been in her manner a tenderness and
embarrassment which implied a wish for
reconciliation, if not a regret for the past.
</p>

<p>
Prompted by this idea, he went up to Mrs. Vyner,
and began a long conversation with her,
at the termination of which he asked if he
might be allowed to pay his respects to her
some morning.
</p>

<p>
"Always delighted to receive you, Mr. St. John,
that you must know; indeed, I should
pick a quarrel with you for not having called
before, but that I suppose you have some
excellent excuse."
</p>

<p>
"Then, to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow we shall be at home."
</p>

<p>
The morrow came, and Julius, resolved at any
rate not to lose Rose as a <i>friend</i> (beautiful
sophistry of lovers!), was punctual in his visit.
He was there before every one else.  Vyner and
his wife were alone in the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"Let Miss Vyner know that Mr. St. John is
here," said Mrs. Vyner to the servant.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Rose came down: a volume
was in her hand, and it caught the eye of her
lover as soon as she appeared.  She was very
agitated, but shook him by the hand as if
nothing particular was about to transpire.  She
tried to join in the conversation, but could
never finish a sentence.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner left the room shortly afterwards,
and then Rose suddenly remembered that papa
had bought a new and rare edition of Horace,
which she was sure Mr. St. John would like
to see.
</p>

<p>
Julius expressed enthusiastic eagerness.
</p>

<p>
Vyner thought he could lay his hand on it
in a minute, and trotted away to his study for
that purpose.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had he left the room than Rose,
blushing and trembling, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here is a book .... I meant to give it you
.... before you left the Hall .... that night."
</p>

<p>
She could say no more.  He snatched the
volume from her hand: it was Leopardi.  A
thrill of rapture ran through his whole being;
and, in a voice choked with emotion, he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Rose .... dearest Rose .... is this .... is
this the answer to my .... to my letter?"
</p>

<p>
"It is."
</p>

<p>
He clasped her in his arms, and, with hysterical
passion, groaned, as he held her to his
heart.
</p>

<p>
"Here is my treasure .... Eh?" said
Vyner, opening the door, and discovering the
lovers in that unambiguous embrace.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him all," whispered Rose in Julius's
ear, as she fled in confusion from the room.
</p>

<p>
Julius did tell all; and that very hour Vyner
gave his delighted consent.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
ANOTHER LOVE SCENE.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>Claude</i>.&mdash;"Miserable trickster! you know that your weapon
is harmless!&mdash;You have the courage of the mountebank, sir,
not the bravo."
</p>

<p class="intro">
BULWER.&mdash;<i>Lady of Lyons.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That very day a strangely different scene took
place in that house.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner was in that famous boudoir
before described; Maxwell was gloomily pacing
it to and fro.  He was there for the purpose of
having an "explanation"; but he found her
more than a match for him, and was now trying
to beat from his stupid brain a convincing
argument.
</p>

<p>
"You don't love me," he at last exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Have you come here to tell me that?  If
so, I would have you observe, that you have
chosen a singularly inappropriate occasion."
</p>

<p>
"I say you don't love me," he repeated, and
his eyes sparkled with malignant fire.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not.  You do not take the way to
make me love you."
</p>

<p>
This was said with such an air of quiet indifference,
that he paused to look at her, as if he
could read on her brow a confirmation of what
she said.
</p>

<p>
"I do not love you then!" he said bitterly.
"I have not loved you for two years .... not
saying; a word about it .... loving you in
secret .... seeing others more favoured, seeing
others looking into your face as I dare not
look .... suffering tortures of jealousy .... I
do not take the way to gain your love! what
way should I then take?"
</p>

<p>
"Be amiable .... women are not captivated
by scowls .... George, you are unjust to me.
Sit down, and listen to me calmly.  Remember
my position."
</p>

<p>
"You take care I shall not forget it."
</p>

<p>
"Would you then forget it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; for it keeps you from me.  It is in
your mouth at all times.  'My position' is your
excuse for everything."
</p>

<p>
"And is it not a valid excuse?"
</p>

<p>
"No; it is not: it is a mere excuse.  Remember
your position, indeed! why do you
love another man than your husband, if your
<i>position</i> forbids it?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in surprise, but even her
tiger eyes quailed beneath the savage glance of
her brutal lover.  She felt that he was her
<i>master</i>!  He was not to be led as Marmaduke
had been led, because in him there was none of
the generous principle, or chivalric sensibility,
which made Marmaduke, in spite of his
impetuosity, pliable and manageable.  He had
almost as much vehemence, and infinitely more
brutality.  She saw all this; yet she loved him.
Strange paradox of human nature, she loved
the fierce, narrow-minded, ungenerous Maxwell,
with a far deeper passion than she had felt for
the generous, open-hearted, high-spirited
Marmaduke!  It may be that she felt more
sympathy with a being of a lower order; or it
may be that Maxwell alone had conquered her:
certain it is, that she felt for him another kind
of passion, and was more his slave than he
hers.  By a not uncommon transposition of
places, he, who as an unacknowledged lover had
been the most abject slave, became, when
acknowledged, the most unflinching tyrant.  This
is generally the case with brute natures.
</p>

<p>
It is not to be supposed that she submitted
quietly.  She was too fond of power to
relinquish it without a struggle; but although
ridicule was a weapon she wielded with unsparing
skill, and a weapon he dreaded more than
any other; yet even that was but a small sword
which was beaten down by the heavy sabre of
his fierce sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"You do not answer me," he said, irritated
at her silence.
</p>

<p>
"Until you can speak to me as a gentleman,"
she replied, "I shall remain silent."
</p>

<p>
"That is an easy way of ending an argument."
</p>

<p>
"There is an easier."
</p>

<p>
"Is there, indeed?"
</p>

<p>
"And more efficient&mdash;do not force me to it."
</p>

<p>
"Pray what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"To leave the room."
</p>

<p>
She rose and walked to the door.  He seized
her wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go, sir; you hurt me.....  This
violence is <i>manly</i>&mdash;but it is like you.....  Let
me go.....  Will you force me to ring the
bell, and have you ordered out of the house?"
</p>

<p>
"Ring the bell! you dare not ring it!  I
defy you.....  What could you say? what do
I do here? .... Ring it, by all means!"
</p>

<p>
She was stung by his manner, and looking
on him with intense scorn, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I will."
</p>

<p>
As she moved towards the bell, he drew a
pistol from his pocket.  She started, terrified at
the sight.
</p>

<p>
"You brave me, do you?" he said, hoarse
with passion; "you brave me; well! ring!"
</p>

<p>
Her hand was on the bell: she hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"What means that?  Do you intend to
murder me?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I do!</i>"
</p>

<p>
She did not start, she did not scream; a
smile of unutterable scorn passed over her face.
</p>

<p>
"Ring it, I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"You wish me to order you to be turned out?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to end this struggle&mdash;and I declare
to God that I will end it, either in my favour,
or with your life.  I am reckless; choose you!
You think I am a fool; you are mistaken: I
am no fool; nor shall you make me one.  You
say you love me; I hope for your sake you
speak truly; if you do not, you shall not live
to torture me."
</p>

<p>
"Your hand trembles."
</p>

<p>
"It is with passion, then.  It is because the
crisis has arrived.  It is because this is the
moment that must decide everything."
</p>

<p>
Her hand was still upon the bell.  Her
calmness puzzled and exasperated him, and when
she said with a slight irony in her tone,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And you really talk of shooting me, to
prove your love?"
</p>

<p>
He levelled the pistol at her, and shouted,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ring the bell, and try me!"
</p>

<p>
"I will.  But first allow me to observe, that
if there is one thing more despicable than the
threat you make, it is to commit the exquisitely
ridiculous mistake of <i>acting</i> such a part as you
now act.  Passion might excuse the <i>deed</i>;
nothing can efface the childish stupidity of the
<i>pretence</i>.  Mr. Maxwell, when next you get up
a scene like this, at least take care that your
pistol is <i>loaded</i>; yours has no cap!"
</p>

<p>
Having uttered this in the coldest, calmest
tone imaginable, she rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
A cry burst from him as he looked down,
and saw in truth, that there was no cap on the
nipple.  He thrust the pistol into his pocket,
and threw himself into a chair in wild confusion.
</p>

<p>
The servant entered.
</p>

<p>
"Order a cab for Mr. Maxwell," Mrs. Vyner
said.
</p>

<p>
The servant retired, and they were again
alone.  Not a word passed.  Overwhelmed
with rage and shame, Maxwell sat brooding
on his stormy thoughts.  Mrs. Vyner watched
him with scorn: he had lost the hold over
her which his violence had gained: she now
thought that he was not so terrible as
Marmaduke had been, and from having feared, she
now despised him.
</p>

<p>
"The cab is at the door," said the servant.
</p>

<p>
Maxwell did not move.  His dark thoughts
occupied him.  It had been no vulgar threat,
for the pistol was really loaded, although the
cap had been forgotten; but he understood the
contempt with which she must regard him, and
he was ruminating projects of vengeance.
</p>

<p>
She had taken up a book and was affecting
to read, as if undisturbed by his presence; he
was made aware of it by the rustle of the leaves
as she turned them over; and conscious of the
disadvantage of his position, he at length arose,
and looking at her malignantly, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You fancy me an actor; I am one; my first
appearance has been in a farce; laugh, laugh! my
next will be in a tragedy!"
</p>

<p>
And with a low bow he retired.

GEORGE SAND.&mdash;<i>La Comtesse de Rudolstadt.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Your letter, dearest Marmaduke, was a great
joy to me, but the joy was dashed with pain as
I came to the close, and read there the hope you
express of our speedy union.  No, that cannot
be.  Oh, do you not feel that it cannot be? do
you not feel that it does not depend upon my
love, but upon the irrevocable past?  I thought
I had made you understand all my feelings on
this unhappy subject, and that I might write to
you freely without awakening in either of us a
hope which cannot be gratified.  Your letter has
greatly pained me; pained me because you
seem to think that, inasmuch as we both love,
we must be united&mdash;that love will bear down all
obstacles and triumph at last.  But no; that
cannot be.  If there were the remotest chance
of it, do you think I should not catch at such a
hope with all the impatient eagerness of love?
Have I nothing to subdue?  Have I no
temptations to overcome?  Think, Marmaduke, my
noble Marmaduke, think of what I have suffered
and must still suffer when I look upon our
fate, and yet can say, am forced to say, we must
never meet!  I fled from London, fled from you,
because I feared the insidious counsels of my
heart.  My reason tells me that I acted
rightly&mdash;do you not feel so too?
</p>

<p>
I had looked forward to this correspondence
with such longing!  I had pictured all the
rapture it would give us both; and see! the
first letter from you rips up old wounds, and
draws from me bitter, bitter tears.
</p>

<p>
It must cease, unless you can accept my hard
conditions.  It must cease, Marmaduke, for I
dare not let it continue.  I could not trust
myself&mdash;I should allow myself to be
persuaded&mdash;your hopes would become my hopes&mdash;your
prayers would melt my resolution.  I know it.
I know my own heart; I know its strength and
its weakness, and I feel that it would be madness
in me to expose myself to the temptation of
corresponding with you on <i>that</i> subject.  You
would defeat me at last; and I must not, I will
not be defeated!  Therefore, promise me at
once to accept my conditions, promise to love
me as one whom an inevitable fate has separated
from you, and for ever.  Let us at the outset
understand the relation which can alone exist
between us.  We love, but we must love without
hope.  Let us accept our fate&mdash;a fate which our
murmurs or our struggles cannot alter, and in
this resignation our love will be as a guiding
star to light us through life; let our souls blend
into one; let our hearts never be separated, and
we shall live together in spirit, though distant
from each other.  This is not the happy lot
which might have been ours, but it is the
happiest which remains for us.  Isolated we
shall be; without home, without family; but
life will still have one sacred feeling one
immeasurable delight, and above the turmoils and
petty cares of the world there will be a heaven
for us.
</p>

<p>
Will you accept my love upon such terms?
Will you struggle with yourself as I have
struggled, and conquer as I have conquered?
</p>

<p>
I may seem cold in writing thus!  Oh, do
not think it; do not think that this conquest
has been lightly made!  I love you, love you
with the passionate excess of a fervid nature:
but the stern necessities of our condition
imprison me in this reserve.  It is because I see
no outlet that I am so firm; and it is only since
I have clearly seen my lot is inevitable that I
have learned to be calm and happy.  Write to
me without delay, write to tell me that you do
not misunderstand me&mdash;that you do not think
me cold: oh, you cannot think <i>that</i>!  Write to
me to tell me that you see, as I see, how our
only chance of happiness is in resignation&mdash;in
love without hope.  Write to me to tell me that
my love will be as a star to you in your ambitious
career, and that when the busy day is done, and
night with all its deep repose comes on, your
thoughts will then rise from the occupations of
the day to that serener sphere where souls
commingle.  For my love <i>will</i> be this to you,
dearest; I know it, since I interpret my own
heart for you.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
FRANK IN REDUCED CIRCUMSTANCES.
</h3>

<p>
Little Rose Blanche throve apace; but Cecil's
painting proceeded slowly, and his mind was
still more busy with those imaginary games in
which his success was greater and greater
every day.
</p>

<p>
Rose and Julius were in that feverish condition
which is common to lovers, whirled amidst
the bustle of marriage preparations.
</p>

<p>
Fevers are not usually enviable things; but
that is a kind of fever which we all envy.  The
Present how crowded, how occupied, how
intense! the Future, how radiant, how
dream-peopled!  The pulse beats, the brain is
over-excited, the step is light (and the head also),
the face wears an aspect of everlasting
beatitude, the hand is generous, the whole man is
in a dream.
</p>

<p>
Some people, indeed, "wondered" at the
match; some very ill-favoured men couldn't,
for the life of them, imagine what she could see
in that ugly fellow: while others, less
charitable (they were females), would be sorry to
hint at anything illiberal, but they really did
think that Rose Vyner, though a lively girl
enough, and all that sort of thing, was scarcely
the girl to make a good wife.  But none of
these opinions reached the ears of the parties
concerned; and the circle of the Vyners, and
the St. Johns was, with few exceptions,
sincerely rejoiced at the approaching marriage.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, while Cecil was laboriously
painting, Frank Forrester knocked at his door.
</p>

<p>
"Not at home, sir," said the girl, resolutely.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" said Frank, introducing his person
into the passage.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed he is not, sir; and he's very
particularly engaged."
</p>

<p>
"You see, my lily of Westminster .... for
you are a lily, damn my whiskers!" said
Frank, passing his arm round her waist, and
kissing her smutty and reluctant cheek; "you
see I understand perfectly well, that it is
your business to say your master's not at
home...."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; he told me so strictly."
</p>

<p>
"But it is my business not to believe you
... so announce me, you peony of Pimlico! announce
me .... No; I'll announce myself."
</p>

<p>
So saying, Frank marched up stairs, and
without ceremony walked into the <i>atélier</i>.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was embarrassed at seeing him.
</p>

<p>
"What's this? cut so old a chum as Frank
Forrester!  Not at home to Frank!  Damn
my whiskers! it is enough to make one give the
lie to those prime histories of ancient
friendship; the Damons and Pythiases didn't say
not at home to each other, I presume....
What's the start, Cis, my boy?  How is it we
never see you?  How is it I am denied
whenever I present my agreeable person at your
inhospitable door?"
</p>

<p>
Cecil briefly explained to him the change
which had taken place in his finances and his
habits.
</p>

<p>
"Quite right too, Cis.  Damn it! there's
nothing to be done at <i>rouge et noir</i>.  I have
quite given it up!  Unfortunately, not before
it cleaned me out.  You see," he added, looking
down upon his costume, "I am not magnificent
.... I don't flourish."
</p>

<p>
To judge by his appearance, indeed, he did
not flourish; and Cecil could not help being
painfully struck with the contrast between his
costume now, and when last he saw him.
Rings, chains, studs, shirt pin, and cane were
gone.  The hat was greasy, and glossy from
being carefully brushed after repeated wettings;
the cut-away coat was so threadbare, and its
collar so greasy, that it seemed as if it had
been worn for ten years, and was hourly in
danger of falling to pieces.  The double-breasted
waistcoat, the brilliant shawl-pattern of which
was now greatly faded, was buttoned up to
the throat.  The sky-blue trousers, worn at
the seams, and bagged at the knees, were
tightly strapped over a pair of decent boots.
Altogether, there was such unmistakeable
poverty, coupled with such an attempt at style,
that his appearance was singularly painful.  It
was not humble poverty; it was faded splendour.
It was the wreck of a man about town.
</p>

<p>
His face also showed the effects of the
change.  Poverty had brought with it a forced
abstinence from that excitement which hitherto
had sustained him; and every one knows the
effects which follow any cessation of
accustomed stimulus.  Frank having been used to
live freely, sometimes intemperately, now drank
water.  Accustomed to the excitement of the
gaming-table, he now could rarely indulge in
it.  Some men, forced to abstain from wine,
would have taken to spirits, or even beer; but
Frank damned his whiskers, and declared he
was a gentleman, and had never learned to
"guzzle": if he could not get wine, and good
wine, he would not defile his palate with
vulgar drinks.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" asked Cecil.
</p>

<p>
"Living the life of a beast, damn my
whiskers! dining off a solitary chop, lounging
about to be cut by former associates, making
vain attempts to induce my friends to go
through the matter of form of putting their
names to a bill, and moralizing on the
fragility of human friendship, and the limits of
human credit."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but have you no means of getting
a livelihood?'
</p>

<p>
"What means?  You don't expect me to
turn painter, and be moral like yourself, do
you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; but still, my dear Frank, you
must do something."
</p>

<p>
"Something will turn up, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"But if nothing should turn up, what can
the end be?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! a new broom and a crossing!  That's
a <i>dernière ressource</i>;&mdash;not a bad one, either.  A
man 'sees life' at a crossing;&mdash;besides, the
occupation's healthy&mdash;all in the open air.  I
should make a fortune at it.  Damme! a
gentleman with a broom&mdash;that would produce
an effect, I think!"
</p>

<p>
Cecil shook his head, though he could not
refrain from smiling at Frank's coolness.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't such a thing as a sovereign
about you, eh?" said Frank, combing the long
thin hair over the top of his head, so as to hide
his daily increasing baldness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Frank, I have, and very much at your
service."
</p>

<p>
"You're a trump!" said Frank, jumping up,
and shaking him by the hand.  "I have asked
that question of eight of my friends within the
last two days, and&mdash;it was very unfortunate&mdash;but
at that moment not one of them could
lay his hand upon such a thing, damn my
whiskers!"
</p>

<p>
Cecil passed the sovereign to him.
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, I shall dine to-day," Frank
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Is that anything new, then?"
</p>

<p>
"So completely novel, that it has not occurred
this whole week.  In fact, I haven't what I call
<i>dined</i> for a month; I have only stifled the baser
cravings of hunger, but not satisfied those higher
and, perhaps, more imperious cravings of the
man who knows how to dine.  For, as you know,
it is one thing to eat, another thing to eat as an
intellectual being should eat.  It breaks my heart
to pass the club windows, and know how many
facilities there are within of dining as a man
with an immortal soul should dine,&mdash;and to
reflect how few among the diners know how to
accomplish that solemnity."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but do you mean to say that, in your
present state of finances, you intend spending
that sovereign on your dinner?"
</p>

<p>
"That, or the greater part of it," replied
Frank, with considerable seriousness.  "I have
a strong desire to <i>dine</i>.  I can support hunger,
I can live upon a crust (if forced), but, damn
my whiskers! from time to time I must satisfy
the higher cravings of my nature, and dine."
</p>

<p>
"Frank, you shall dine to-day, and at my
invitation; save that sovereign for next week.  I
warn you, that you will seldom get one from me
after this; for I myself am poor.  So make the
most of it; but to-day we'll dine together."
</p>

<p>
"We will; the suggestion does credit to your
head and heart, Cis."

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
EFFECTS OF DINING WELL.
</h3>

<p>
After a dinner at the Thatched House, limited
in the number of dishes, but selected with the
skill of a Frank Forrester, and assisted by a
bottle of Barsac, two bottles of Æil-de-perdrix,
and a bottle of Romané, the two friends were
seated at the table in that state of indolent
beatitude which succeeds a scientifically-chosen
repast.  The pulse is heightened, but digestion
is light; the brain is active, yet somewhat
dreamy; the will seems lulled, and anything
like an effort seems impossible.
</p>

<p>
Sipping their Burgundy, Frank and Cecil
sat talking over the various experiences of
their lives, especially with women&mdash;a subject
on which men are usually communicative
during such hours.  Frank was inexhaustible in
stories, which made Cecil roll with laughter, or
listen with breath-suspended interest.  Meanwhile
the lights grew dimmer, and their brains
grew heavier: the Burgundy was steadily
overcoming them.  Frank perceiving it, made a
movement to go.  Cecil tried to persuade him
to have another bottle, but he was resolute;
and having paid the bill, they departed.
</p>

<p>
The fresh air somewhat dissipated the effect
of the wine, but Cecil was now in a state of
craving for a fresh sensation; and when Frank
announced his intention of trying his luck with
the sovereign he had borrowed, Cecil noisily
declared he would go with him.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I intend to play, though.  No, no,
I've given that up; that won't do.  But come
along, Frank; anything for a lark.  Lalla-liety!
Lalla-liety!" he shouted, in a feeble
falsetto, as if announcing to the universe that
he was not the boy to go home till morning did
appear.
</p>

<p>
When they entered the gaming-house, Cecil,
though perfectly aware of everything he did
and said, was still what is called "far gone";
and the dazzling lights, the well-known cries,
the chink of the money, the click of the rake
against the coin, the murmur of conversation,
all conspired to intoxicate him.
</p>

<p>
While Frank played, he walked about the
room, observing the various countenances of
the players.  In one corner sat a young man
of about three and twenty, haggard and pale:
he was weeping silently, the tears rolling
unheeded down his cheeks, and falling upon the
ground, while every now and then a stifled sob
seemed to tear his breath.  He had lost all.
</p>

<p>
There was something so painful in this retired
sorrow; that Cecil, who was contemplating
him with a sort of drunken compassion, went
up to him, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do not be downcast, sir, fortune may
change.  Have you lost much?"
</p>

<p>
"Seventeen pounds," sobbed the young man;
"but it was my all&mdash;I am ruined! utterly
ruined!  Fortune cannot change for me, for I
shall never have another sixpence, to tempt her
with.  O my poor mother! my poor mother!"
</p>

<p>
A tear stood in Cecil's eye, and he hiccupped.
He was debating with himself whether he
should give the unhappy youth a chance of
recovering his gains.  At last, slipping a half
sovereign into his hand, he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;risk that.  But if you win back
your money, promise me solemnly never to play
again.  You may not another time find one to
give you a chance."
</p>

<p>
The bloodshot eyes of the youth flashed fire
as he saw the piece of gold in his hand.  He
tried to utter his thanks, but a sort of gurgling
murmur was all that escaped.  He instantly
went to the table and began to play.  Cecil,
interested in his fate, stood beside him.
</p>

<p>
He won, and won, and won.  In a quarter of
an hour, in spite of several losses, he had
recovered his seventeen pounds, and five more
with them.  He repaid Cecil the half sovereign,
and clasping his hand, said fervently:&mdash;"God
bless you! you have saved a fellow-creature!"
and ran rather than walked out of the house.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had he departed than, strange
inconsistency!  Cecil began to play.
</p>

<p>
The young man's presence had been a restraint
on him, which not even the intoxicating sight
of the gold could overcome.  He had presented
himself as a Mentor to that young man, and
could not in his presence descend from the
pedestal; accordingly he was irritably anxious
for his protégé to win, and to depart.  All the
time he had been standing at the table, a sort
of fever of cupidity possessed him.  He staked
imaginary sums, and always, or almost always,
won.  Yes, even with the game played before
him, he juggled with himself almost as much
as when alone in his <i>atélier</i> he played those
successful games.  Whoever has stood at a
table where a game of chance is being played,
and has, in imagination only, participated,
must remember this:&mdash;We choose a side; if it
is victorious, we reflect how great would have
been our gain; if it is unsuccessful, we say to
ourselves, "There would have been a loss;" but
we do not, to our minds, realize that loss with
anything like the vividness with which we
realize the gain; and, moreover, we constantly
shelter ourselves under the idea that "most
likely we should not, after all, have chosen that
side."
</p>

<p>
This was the process going on in Cecil's
mind as he stood by that table, and saw the
game played; and he was impatient for his
protégé to begone: so impatient that he cared
not whether the youth won or lost; and indeed
at one period when the losses were frequent,
he was rather disappointed to see a gain follow
them, because it deferred the youth's exit.
Such is human egotism!
</p>

<p>
No sooner was he freed from this restraint
than, heedless of the whispers of his conscience,
he flung down a sovereign, and was soon
absorbed in the game.
</p>

<p>
Frank presently came round to him, having
lost back twenty pounds which he had won,
and now begged another loan.  Cecil took up a
dozen sovereigns from the heap before him,
and handed them to him with a caution to be
careful.
</p>

<p>
Till deep in the night they played, and Cecil
left the house a winner of sixty pounds.  Frank
had lost the twelve lent him, and was savage
against fate.  Cecil, half intoxicated as he was,
and glorying in his winnings, still felt a pressing
sense of remorse, at having been seduced.  But
he vowed that it should never recur again; and
told Frank if ever he proposed to go into
another gaming-house, from that instant their
friendship would be at an end.
</p>

<p>
"I have been led astray to-night," he said,
"but I dare not repeat it.  I know what the
end must be; and nothing shall make me
forget my oath; so remember, Frank, the first
word with which you tempt me, is the word
that parts us for ever!"
</p>

<p>
"I tempt you, indeed!  I didn't propose it
to-night, did I?  Besides, I have abjured the
fickle goddess myself.  I touch no more cards.
Damn my whiskers!"
</p>

<p>
Cecil rose the next morning with a fearful
consciousness of having broken his oath, and
of having again plunged into the mire from
which he had been extricated.  He was ashamed
of his weakness, but tried to convince himself
that it was a moment of intoxication, and would
not recur.
</p>

<p>
That night he took Blanche to her father's;
the next night he invited Rose to come to
them, which invitation, as Julius was included
in it, was accepted.
</p>

<p>
Thus were two days placed as barriers between
him and temptation.  He felt the desire so
strong within him to return to the gaming-table,
that he was obliged to place himself in a
position which would make that return almost
impossible.  But the third night, he had no
engagement.  The passion had grown stronger
from the restraint: it subdued him!  He
struggled with it; he tried to gain courage in
reflecting on the miseries which would ensue;
but the "still small voice," though heard, was
impotent.  Passion bullied Reason into silence;
unable to answer its arguments it gagged them
with a reckless "don't care!"
</p>

<p>
Struggles were vain: the gamester would
fulfil his destiny.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Julius and Rose were married, and a brighter
day never shone upon our island than that
which saw these two admirable creatures
united.
</p>

<p>
Vyner's heart was heavy as he gave her
away; for although he had the highest opinion
of Julius, and thought the match in every way
an excellent one, yet Rose was the only child
he had now at home with him; and his affection,
rejected by his wife, had turned itself once
more towards his children.
</p>

<p>
They set off for a wedding tour, down the
Wye into Wales.  Who shall depict their
silent, deep, unspeakable happiness, as they
felt themselves now for ever united?  Words
have no power of expressing such feelings:
there is no standard to which to refer an
experience which transcends all former
experience.  Either the reader has felt this bliss;
or he will, some day, feel it.  To his own
experience I must refer him.
</p>

<p>
Everything then has a certain newness; yet
everything comes as such a matter of course!
All emotions glide through the soul with such
a soft sure pace, that they excite no surprise
even by their novelty.  The lovers "feel as if
they had been married years;" and yet a
curious sense of novelty is always present.
They do not feel what they expected to feel;
yet are they not surprised.  In fact, they are
all feeling; all deep, vivid, unspeakable
emotion.  Hand clasped in hand, lip pressed to lip,
eyes fixed on eyes, hours of silent and unbroken
bliss pass swiftly on, as if the wide universe
were shrunk into one spot, as if a whole
eternity were not too great to be filled by that
one passion.
</p>

<p>
Love is the intensest form of life.  No
wonder, then, that all human beings crave it; no
wonder that we all feel a perennial interest in
it, and that the look of tenderness we detect
in its passage from one loved being to another,
stirs strange memories in our hearts, and breaks
like a smile over our souls; no wonder that in
the cunning pages of the poet, we are fascinated
by his pictured reflex of those feelings which
belong to our common humanity!
</p>

<p>
Rose and Julius, so fitly formed to be united,
each soul being, in Plato's language, the half
of the other&mdash;the two souls rushing into a
perfect one, and making a harmonious life
between them: she so gay, witty, wild, frank,
and gentle; he so grave, high-souled, earnest-minded,
and so noble; she so beautiful, and he
so honest&mdash;how could they fail to be happy?
</p>

<p>
To Tinterne's lovely scenes they at first
repaired: a delicious spot, made for honeymoons,
did not honeymoons fortunately make every
place a paradise.  The beauty of the spot was
sweetly accordant with their minds; and they
were delighted to alternate the admiration of
nature with their adoration of each other.  The
sky seemed more blue, significant, and tender,
after witnessing a kiss snatched amidst the
tangled overgrowth of shrubs (with most unfeminine
indifference, too, be it said, in passing,
to the crumpling of bonnets!); and the sunny
slopes looked still more verdant, as these lovers
chased each other, like happy children, down
them.
</p>

<p>
I am not going to betray any more of the
secrets of those Eleusinian mysteries of love:
the initiated will understand them; and they
alone are fit to hear them.
</p>

<p>
How Julius and Rose admired Tinterne
Abbey!  Everybody does.  Everybody remembers
Wordsworth's magnificent lines; and
it is the glorious privilege of poetry to open
our eyes to the divinity of beauty which lies
around us, and to confer on nature herself a
splendour not her own.  But lovers have no
need of an hierophant: beauty to them is
visible without the poet's aid; for they
themselves are poets.  And to our lovers the abbey
was more exquisite than to any wayfarer's eye
seeking only the picturesque.
</p>

<p>
"I am often puzzled," said Julius, as they
stood within the majestic ruin, "to explain how
it is that the proportion we so much admire in
ancient and in Gothic architecture should be
the endless despair of the moderns.  With all
our perfection of geometry and masonry, we
are miserably behind our forefathers in the
first principle of art: proportion.  We build
more comfortable houses; but we cannot build
a palace, a temple, or a monument.  The
Comfortable we attain: our efforts after the
Beautiful are singularly feeble and abortive.
I suppose those writers are correct who place
the cause of failure in the absence of that
religious idea which animated the ancients.
Certainly it seems as if we measured with the
rule and compass, rather than with the mind:
we aggregate materials, instead of incarnating
an idea.  We use the symbols of other times,
and build churches and cathedrals with the
columns and façades from sunny Greece, and
the Gothic nave and cross from Germany and
France; the flying buttress and the pointed
arch side by side the architraves and pediments
of Greece!"
</p>

<p>
"You will call me a little ignoramus," replied
Rose; "but I can't help it: I prefer this abbey
in its ruins to any perfect work of art.  No
doubt, in its original state it must have been
very lovely; but look at it now!  With no roof
but heaven, no painted windows, but, instead,
those charming glimpses of the hills around;
and the chinks in the walls&mdash;the ruin with its
moss and lichens, and the soft shadows thrown
on this grassy pavement by the fragments of
beauty which are still remaining&mdash;is not all this
more beautiful than a work of art?"
</p>

<p>
Julius looked into her eyes and thought she
was right; but what stopped his lips from
replying, I leave to the reader's imagination: to
my ears it had a very musical sound.
</p>

<p>
It was in vain they tried to be æsthetical and
talk architecture; the time and mood were not
made for it; and even the exquisite beauty
which surrounded them could only draw from
them fragmentary remarks.  But if they did
not express much, they felt a great deal.
</p>

<p>
It was not a spot to stand on without having
the thoughts constantly withdrawn from the
present to the past, of which it was a fragment.
The mind would wander.  On that very spot
where they stood, had many a pious monk
bowed himself down in prayer: asking, in the
contrition of a weary spirit, for pardon and for
courage.  The faith which moved him has
passed away, effaced beneath the giant march
of time; the tessellated pavement no longer
echoes the slow and heavy tread of monks, but
has been broken and scattered, and has passed
away with the faith it served; and, like that
faith, exists only in broken fragments, curious
amongst the weeds that have usurped its place.
The painted windows

<p class="noindent">

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Looking on these fragments which speak feelingly
of the decay and change of all things, a
soft melancholy would invade their minds.
</p>

<p>
"Everything then changes, is it so?" asked
Rose.
</p>

<p>
"Everything," he replied, "but love; and
that sustains the world."
</p>

<p>
Did I not say that lovers were poets?  Here
is Julius talking a language that would surprise
himself, were it not the natural expression of
his feelings.  And Rose&mdash;instead of being witty
and sparkling&mdash;Rose was throughout their tour
so serious and sentimental, that no one would
have recognised her; but she was intensely
happy in her melancholy, and would not have
changed it for all the gaieties in the world.
</p>

<p>
While I contemplate, not without a touch of
envy, this change and its cause, it occurs to
me, that as I am, unluckily, in no danger of
falling into the error myself, I may, to follow
my usual bent, moralize for a moment on this
all interesting subject of honeymoons.
</p>

<p>
Rightly is the first month of marriage called
a honeymoon: a period of unceasing sweetness,
cloying at last upon the palled and exhausted
palate, unless it have something higher and
better upon which to rest than its mere sweetness.
Before the year is out, the "happy pair"
have, alas! too often found indifference succeed
to this all-exacting, all-impatient passion; a
consummation not easily to be avoided, but
perhaps, to be delayed.
</p>

<p>
Many ingenious writers have tried their hands
at a definition of love; may I not venture after
them?
</p>

<p>
Love, in its commonest form, I take to be
an <i>enthusiasm with which the mind intensifies and
dignifies its desires</i>.  Unhappily, in most cases,
it is only a passing enthusiasm, dying away
with the gratification of its desires; and dying,
because not founded on lasting qualities; dying,
because the sympathies are not involved, because
the moral requirements are not responded to
with the same facility as the physical.  A love,
whose root is in passion, and only in passion,
cannot be supposed to survive the first ardour
of that passion.  It is only when above and
beyond that passion, giving it force and perpetually
renewing it as from a central fire, there
exists what I should call a moral passion,&mdash;an
intense moral desire,&mdash;that the love can be
durable.  The sensuous desire is violent but limited;
the moral desire is infinite: the craving which
soul feels for perfect communion with soul, and
the infinite variety with which that desire is
maintained, give to love its lustre and its
immortality.
</p>

<p>
But how are we to distinguish between these
two kinds of love?  How is a man to know
whether he loves in the complete and exalted
manner last described, and not in the limited,
instinctive, perishable manner?  There, I
confess, lies the mystery.  Time alone can solve it.
No man can well discriminate in his own
case, and precisely for the reason that love is
an enthusiasm, which not only intensifies, but
also <i>dignifies</i> his desires, so that in his eyes,
his passion appears exalted, imperishable,
unchangeable.
</p>

<p>
How many an unhappy wretch has awakened
from a dream of passion, to find that after all it
was only his enthusiasm which dignified the
object which dignified his passion, and threw
around it the lustre of immortal youth!
</p>

<p>
To think of this, to see in your own
experience so many examples, is enough to make
you register a vow that you will never&mdash;no
never again fall in love.  The vow may be
registered; Love, who "laughs at locksmiths,"
knows the durability of such barriers as vows;
and, looking down with the saucy pity of
that imp Puck, exclaims&mdash;

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
AMIABLE PEOPLE.
</h3>

<p>
It was November.  Rose and Julius had returned
to London to continue their felicity in a
new sphere: they were quite a model couple,
and were so happy that several people "of
experience" shook their heads sceptically, and
exclaimed:&mdash;"Ah, well! early times yet, early
times!"
</p>

<p>
What a world of envy in a little phrase!
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner grew morose.  His domestic
comfort was now utterly destroyed, for his wife
was entirely estranged from him; and he was
without hope of her ever returning to the former
state of hypocritical fondness.  Beyond this,
Violet would not remain in the house with her
step-mother; so that except in his visits to
Rose he saw no one that he loved.  Blanche was
also separated from him: her husband absolutely
interdicted all communication between her and
her father.  This was the result of a violent
quarrel on the old subject of his gambling, and
of her father's attempt to get her from him.
</p>

<p>
Cecil's passion for gambling had returned
with more than its former force and recklessness.
Vyner had discovered it; had suppressed
the allowance; lectured Cecil sharply, and
endeavoured to persuade Blanche to leave him.
A complete rupture was the consequence.
</p>

<p>
The miserable old man saw his daughter's
impending ruin, and saw that he was impotent
to save her from it.  This, added to his domestic
sorrows, made him morose.  He was a changed
being.  He became dirtier and dirtier.  He
never quoted Horace.  The dust collected on
his manuscripts like the grains of snuff upon
his waistcoat, without any effort on his part to
shake them off.  Life to him was purposeless,
joyless.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner was as lively and dissipated as
ever.  No care sat upon her brow; no sorrow
darkened her existence.  For some weeks after
the scene between her and Maxwell, he ceased
to see her; a circumstance which made her
husband for a moment rejoice; he believed that
a rupture having taken place, his wife would
return to him.  The hope was not of long
duration.  She, at first indifferent, became at
last uneasy at Maxwell's absence.  She loved
him, she was accustomed to his presence, she
liked the excitement of his love, with its fierce
whims, its brutal expressions, and its passionate,
unrestrained vehemence.  She <i>missed</i> him.
</p>

<p>
Unable longer to bear his absence, she wrote
a long and touching letter, in which real feeling
aided her natural adroitness, and gained the
victory.
</p>

<p>
Maxwell was on the point of giving way,
when it reached him.  Obstinate, violent, and
revengeful as he was, he too was so uneasy at
being absent from her, that he was glad to have
such an excuse for forgiveness.  He felt as if
he could have stabbed her to the heart; yet he
was softened in an instant by her letter.
</p>

<p>
Peace was made between them.  He promised
never again to doubt her love; she
promised never again to offend him.  Things
resumed their old course; yes, even to the
renewal of his jealousy and his threats; but on
the whole Mrs. Vyner's brow was smooth!
</p>

<p>
Not very long after the reconciliation, they
were together at a party at Mrs. Langley
Turner's.  Among the company there happened
to be Lord * * * *, notorious in his early days
for his successful gallantries, and not having
yet relinquished the ambition of making
conquests.  He sat next to Mrs. Vyner, who was
that evening in high spirits, and looked
enchantingly <i>piquante</i>.  She was a violent radical
in her opinions, and a great tuft-hunter; a title
was always resplendent in her eyes, no matter
what the wearer might be like.  It is easily
conceivable therefore, how, both as a coquette
and a tuft-hunter, she should have been
inordinately gratified at the attentions of Lord
* * * *.  She put forth all her fascinations;
and although from time to time she met the
dark scowl of Maxwell, who was observing her
like a panther watching from his jungle, she
only answered his anger with a scornful smile,
and continued her attentions to the old nobleman.
</p>

<p>
As Maxwell saw her rise to depart, he hurried
down stairs to the cloak-room, and there
awaited her with the intention of expressing
his anger, as he handed her into the carriage;
but to his rage he saw Lord * * * * accompany
her down stairs, gallantly cover her white
shoulders with the shawl, and then handing
her to the carriage, take leave of her in the most
significant manner.
</p>

<p>
Maxwell with difficulty restrained himself
from challenging his rival on the spot.
</p>

<p>
The next day when he called on Mrs. Vyner,
he saw a cab drive from the door: it was Lord
* * * * coming from his first visit.  Maxwell
refused to go in.
</p>

<p>
Day after day he saw that cab standing
there for an hour or two together; he waited in
the street the whole time, and in his
impatience the hour seemed quadrupled.  It was
enough to irritate the least jealous of men;
him it drove to phrenzy.
</p>

<p>
Pale with passion he at last went in, and
found the two together.  She received him
with easy unconcern, as if he were no more
than an <i>habitué</i>.  Lord * * * * looked somewhat
"glum" at his presence, and after a few
commonplaces, rose and departed.
</p>

<p>
"So," said Maxwell to her when they were
alone, "my place is taken, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"What! jealous again?"
</p>

<p>
"Not jealous, but convinced."
</p>

<p>
"Convinced of your own folly?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then, there are hopes of a reformation.
George, don't scowl in that way; you are not
handsome at any time, and when you scowl,
least of all."
</p>

<p>
"Mary, you must see him no more."
</p>

<p>
"Him? explain: I hate enigmas."
</p>

<p>
"Lord * * * * I insist upon it."
</p>

<p>
"Now, don't be absurd, pray!  Why should
I not see a man old enough to be my father?"
</p>

<p>
"But not too old to be your lover."
</p>

<p>
"The old story!  What a queer creature you
are!  Why, who ever could suppose there was
danger in a man of his age&mdash;he hasn't an
unbleached hair on his head."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not; but a coronet hides that."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!  Oh, you green-eyed monster!
Really, you are capital fun, though you
don't mean it."
</p>

<p>
"Beware, beware!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! now you are getting tragic ... have
you an unloaded pistol about you by chance?"
</p>

<p>
A dark smile passed over his face.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, listen to me: I am very serious.
Laugh, if you please, at my jealousy, but at
any rate, acknowledge that I have a right to
insist on a cessation of his visits."
</p>

<p>
"I acknowledge nothing of the kind.  Why
am I to be deprived of seeing whom I please?
My husband does not object to my receiving
Lord * * * * why should you?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you take pleasure in those visits."
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
"They flatter you."
</p>

<p>
"They do."
</p>

<p>
"He flatters you."
</p>

<p>
"He is gallant enough to find my society
agreeable&mdash;that is more than I can say for
yours at this moment."
</p>

<p>
"You think it a feather in your cap to have
a worthless old nobleman dangling after you."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I do; what then?"
</p>

<p>
"I will not allow it."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come; this is getting a little too
imperious."
</p>

<p>
"I will not allow it, I say."
</p>

<p>
"Your permission is not necessary."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you it <i>shall not be</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"George&mdash;I am serious now&mdash;as you raise
your voice&mdash;if you know me, you must know
that I may be persuaded to anything, but I am
not to be <i>driven</i>.  Obstinacy may not be an
amiable quality; but it is a quality which
belongs to me.  Cease that tone of command
therefore; you will get nothing by it."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not cease that tone.  I shall adopt
any tone I please."
</p>

<p>
"Do so; then don't wonder if I refuse to
listen to you."
</p>

<p>
"But, by God! you shall listen."
</p>

<p>
"Try me."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes dilated as she said this, though her
voice was perfectly calm.  She was getting
almost as angry as he was.  The spirit of
opposition was abetted by the resolution she
had formed not to rebut the attentions of
Lord * * * *, and she now was roused for
the struggle.
</p>

<p>
And yet, flattered as she undoubtedly was,
by the admiration of the old roué, she loved
Maxwell well enough to have sacrificed that
delight, had he taken another course, had he
implored instead of threatened; but that was
not in his nature, and his brutal imperiousness
roused her to rebellion.
</p>

<p>
He had become livid with passion, and it
was only with great effort that he could
articulate&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Don't play with me ... you know not the
danger ... I warn you ... I warn you."
</p>

<p>
"And I laugh at your threats."
</p>

<p>
"You think I am not serious?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not care a straw whether you are
serious or not."
</p>

<p>
"You are resolved then?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, beware! beware! do not drive me to
the last extremity...."
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"By God!" he exclaimed, striking a small
table with his fist.
</p>

<p>
"See," she said, "you have broken my china&mdash;a
real bit of rococo; that's what it is to be
ungentlemanly and violent."
</p>

<p>
"Mary ... This is .... You are rushing to
destruction!  Look here; I am almost mad
... but I know what I say ... choose whether you
will obey me&mdash;if you do not, as I live, I will
blow your brains out, and then my own!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Maxwell, if you think I am to be
frightened by your ravings, if you think I am
to obey your ridiculous caprices, if you think
you are to be my <i>master</i>, you are egregiously
mistaken.  Leave the house: <i>I hate you</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Her look expressed her hate, as she said this.
</p>

<p>
He was convulsed; the veins started on his
forehead; his chest heaved laboriously, and his
eyes were dilated with fury, but he uttered no
sound.
</p>

<p>
"Your love is degradation!  Your soul is as
ignoble as your manners are brutal!  I have
put up with this too long.  I have been
contaminated by your presence, and now, I hate
you!"
</p>

<p>
A sort of gurgle, like the death rattle, sounded
in his throat; his face was purple.
</p>

<p>
"I hate you!" she added.  "Is that clear?
Do you understand me now!"
</p>

<p>
With his eyes fixed horribly upon her
furious countenance, he put his handkerchief
to his mouth; when he removed it, she saw
that it was stained with blood.
</p>

<p>
A sudden sickness overcame her, and she
trembled.
</p>

<p>
He did not speak another word, but staggered
rather than walked towards the door.  Slowly
he descended the stairs, and with his handkerchief
still at his mouth reached home.  The
paroxysm of passion had burst a small bloodvessel.
</p>

<p>
Left to herself, Mrs. Vyner sank on a couch
shivering, and her teeth chattering together
from the combined effects of rage, excitement,
and fear.
</p>

<p>
The heavy pall of a terrible doom seemed
stretched over her future: dark, mysterious,
and awful.  She shuddered as she thought of
what had passed, and only recovered a slight
decree of calmness as the thought occurred to
her that perhaps that broken bloodvessel might
put an end to him!

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
LOVE NOT KILLED BY UNKINDNESS.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  For what will love's exalting not go through,<br>
  'Till long neglect and utter selfishness<br>
  Shames the fond pride it takes in its distress?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEIGH HUNT.&mdash;<i>Rimini.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Cecil had removed to miserable lodgings at
Hammersmith, consisting of two rooms, and
those wretchedly furnished; he had also reduced
his expenses by giving up his <i>atélier</i>, and was
now, without pretence at concealment, a gambler,
and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
Blanche's grief when she first discovered his
relapse was not so great as might have been
expected, simply because she had to defend him
against the bitter accusations of her father, and
in the effort to excuse her husband in the eyes
of another, she succeeded in greatly excusing
him in her own.
</p>

<p>
There were doubtless many sleepless nights
she had to pass, moodily contemplating the
probable consequences of their fate; but when
Cecil came home, her sorrow fled.  Either he
had won, and then his gaiety charmed her, and
she allowed herself to be seduced into sharing
his sanguine expectations; or else he had lost,
and then she had to comfort and console him,
and in that effort to assuage his grief, forgot her
own.
</p>

<p>
There was something indescribably affecting
in the tender solicitude and unshaken love of
this gentle creature for her wretched husband;
she had truly married him for better and for
worse, in sickness and in health, in joy and in
sorrow, and no adversity could alter the current
of that love, which flowed from the everlasting
fountain of her heart.  He had blighted her
youth; he had blighted the existence of their
child; but she loved him perhaps still more
dearly than on that happy day when the priest
had joined them at the altar.  He had been
weak, contemptible, even infamous; but he had
never ceased to be the idol of her heart.
</p>

<p>
One day she missed her watch; that watch
which Cecil had given her, and which had
always been at her side.  She hunted about the
house for it.  All day she was in great distress
at having lost it, and endeavoured in vain to
persuade herself that perhaps Cecil had taken
it out with him.  He returned at two o'clock in
the morning.  Her first question was,
</p>

<p>
"Darling, have you my watch?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said he sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear! oh, dear! it is lost, then&mdash;I have
lost it&mdash;some one has stolen it!"
</p>

<p>
"Pooh! don't make a fuss&mdash;it's all right."
</p>

<p>
"Have you got it?'
</p>

<p>
"No; but I know where it is."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"In a place where it is quite safe&mdash;never
fear!"
</p>

<p>
She understood him.  He had pawned it,
and the proceeds had gone where every shilling
went.
</p>

<p>
Another day she missed the baby's coral with
its golden bells.  This time she said nothing;
she knew too well what must have become of
it, and she burst into tears as she thought of
the fearful situation of a father robbing his own
child to feed an infatuated passion!
</p>

<p>
One by one, every article upon which money
could be raised had disappeared, until he possessed
literally nothing more than the clothes he
stood up in.
</p>

<p>
It was in vain she argued with herself that he,
as the master, had a right to sell his own property,
to sell anything and everything he pleased;
she could not drive away the idea of there being
something sneaking in this furtive disposal of
his goods; an open sale might be necessitated,
but this silent disappearance by stealth of
article after article was horrible.  She never
knew what was gone until she wanted it; and
at last her uneasiness became so great that she
trembled to seek the most trifling thing.
</p>

<p>
Blanche's eyes were not shut to all the weakness
of her husband's character, though her
affection made her sophisticate with herself to
an extraordinary extent.  She saw the deplorable
effects of his infatuation, and tried her best
to wean him from it; but she always trusted
that he would see the folly of the pursuit, and
that, after a certain amount of experience, he
would be cured.  Meanwhile, that hope grew
fainter and fainter, as time, instead of lessening,
seemed to increase his passion.
</p>

<p>
To Vyner, Julius, Rose, and Violet, it seemed
perfectly incomprehensible that Blanche should
continue to love such a wretch as Cecil.
</p>

<p>
"His conduct," Vyner would say, "is enough
to have estranged an angel."
</p>

<p>
Yet the fact is, that his conduct had not in
the least degree alienated her affection from
him; and the explanation of this fact resides
in the moral axiom (the truth of which a large
experience of human nature cannot fail to
illustrate), that affection depends upon <i>character</i>,
not upon <i>conduct</i>.
</p>

<p>
We love those most with whom we sympathize
most, not those from whom we have
received the greatest benefits.  The husband
who ill-treats his wife (as people say) is often
idolized, while the husband who idolizes his
wife is often looked upon as a "good sort of
person" at the best.  No doubt, the ill-treated
wife suffers from, and resents each act of
ill-treatment; as the kindly-treated wife is pleased
and grateful for each act of kindness; but in
the one case, occasional acts cannot destroy
that sympathy which is the bond of love; nor
in the other case, can the occasional kindnesses
create it.  Again, I say it is character, not
conduct, which creates affection.
</p>

<p>
It was Cecil's character that Blanche
sympathized with.  His affectionate, caressing
manners&mdash;his gaiety, his cleverness, and as she
thought genius, were qualities the charm
of which could not be resisted.  Then he
loved her so truly! not enough, indeed, to
forego, for her sake, the excitement of the
gaming-table: not enough to prevent his
sacrificing her with himself to this infatuation: but
that was because he was incapable of <i>self-mastery</i>.
And if he was weak, she sympathized
with his weakness.
</p>

<p>
Turn the phrase how we will, it always comes
back to these simple pregnant words: she loved
him!

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
CAPTAIN HEATH RETURNS.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  O why, when Love doth wound, doth it not then<br>
  Strike deeper down&mdash;and kill!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Old Play.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was not a farthing in the house.  Cecil
was out on the chimerical expedition of
borrowing a few pounds from one of his gaming-table
acquaintances.  Continual assistance had
been lent them by Vyner and by Julius; but,
of course, these sums were dissipated in the
usual way; and so recent had been the assistance,
that even Cecil had not the face to
apply again.
</p>

<p>
Blanche was weeping over the cradle of her
child, whom she had just rocked asleep, when
the door opened, and the servant put in her
head to say,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Please, mum, a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
In another instant, Captain Heath stood
before her with outstretched hand, and
embarrassed countenance: she grasped his hand in
both of hers and pressed it warmly, for she
felt that a deliverer was near.  Since last they
had met, what changes in her life!  What
had they both not undergone!  He was much
thinner, and looked older.  Sorrow had deeply
lined his noble brow, and dimmed his kind
blue eye.  He had sought in travel to forget
the cause of his voluntary exile; and had
learned, if not to forget, at least to master his
feelings.  When men have passed the
impressionable and changeable age of youth, love
becomes a more serious and enduring passion
with them&mdash;it becomes consolidated in their
manhood.  And Captain Heath&mdash;too old not
to have lost all the volatility of youth, but
still too young to have lost its fervour&mdash;found
that his passion for Blanche was ineffaceable.
</p>

<p>
Had he, then, returned with any hopes?
No; his was one of those strong, brave, manly
natures which know how to endure any calamity,
any condition, so soon as it is recognised
as <i>inevitable</i>; they endure, without childish
repining, what they know must be endured;
they brace their minds to the struggle, and
they conquer at least that weak and fretful
anxiety which attends upon those who cannot
calmly look fate in the face.
</p>

<p>
He returned, but it was to watch over his
beloved; and on his return, what was his horror
to hear of the situation into which her wretched
husband had precipitated her!
</p>

<p>
Blanche was embarrassed, yet delighted.
From childhood she had known him, and
loved him almost as a father; and to her old
affection there was now added, the unconscious
flattery of her knowledge of his love for her.
No woman is ever insensible to such flattery;
the man who loves her, though hopelessly, is
always interesting in her eyes.  Blanche was
eminently a woman.
</p>

<p>
"How kind of you to come and see us," she
said, "and in such a place as this!  But then
you are one of our true friends, and poverty
cannot scare you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Blanche, I am your friend: always
remember that, and in any difficulty, be sure not
to forget it.  But let me see your child: she
is asleep?&mdash;what a beauty!  How you must
love it!  Dear little thing, how quiet its
breathing! may I kiss it? will she wake up?"
</p>

<p>
"No; kiss her gently: she is so used to it!"
</p>

<p>
He stooped down, and kissed its warm, soft
cheek, and then gazed at it for some minutes
in silence.  With a mother's pride, Blanche
watched him, occasionally looking down upon
her darling, with that yearning tenderness,
which only mothers know.
</p>

<p>
A low sigh escaped from him as he turned
away from the cradle.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been long in England?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I came home last week.  This is my second
visit."
</p>

<p>
"Your first was to papa, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Things are in a sad state there,
Blanche.  Your father is very much altered.
But what could he expect?  What could induce
him to marry again?"
</p>

<p>
"Mama's conduct is shocking!&mdash;To think
of a wife forgetting herself so!&mdash;Did you see
her?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and she was as civil to me as ever,
talked as hypocritically&mdash;and spoke of you in
terms that made me excessively angry."
</p>

<p>
"What did she say?"
</p>

<p>
"It was not <i>what</i> she said, so much as
the manner of saying it: the tone of pity,
of false pity, affecting to look upon you as
if..."
</p>

<p>
"And what...  Did she speak of ... of Cecil!"
</p>

<p>
Heath was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I know she did; but you must not believe
her; indeed, it is not true&mdash;indeed, he is
not."
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible?"
</p>

<p>
"That is .... she must have exaggerated....
He has been imprudent, unfortunate.... but he
is the kindest, best of men....  They are all
against him; they do not understand him; they
require a man of genius to be as formal and
regular as other men .... absurd, is it not? .... Are
not all men of genius ... are they not?"
</p>

<p>
"Unhappily!" replied Heath.
</p>

<p>
"I know you would not join the cabal against
him.  You are more liberal!  Oh! if you knew
his heart, how good it is!&mdash;I wish he were
here..."
</p>

<p>
At this moment little Rose Blanche cried;
and her mother took her up.  The little creature
was terrified at first seeing the captain,
and clung to her mother for protection; but
after a little coaxing, she became pacified, and
in a few minutes was in his arms and playing
with his dark moustache, which greatly interested her.
</p>

<p>
This interruption saved Heath from an
embarrassing situation, and threw the conversation
entirely upon the child, of whom the fond
mother had innumerable anecdotes to relate, all
of which went to the establishment of the fact,
that for intelligence and goodness, no such baby
was to be met with in the three kingdoms.
Heath was too happy to let the conversation
continue in that strain, and having spent an
agitated yet delicious hour with her, he thought
it time to go.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Blanche," he said at last, "I came
here upon a matter of business, which I must
not forget in the pleasure of seeing you.  My
residence in Italy has developed in me a taste
for pictures.  I am not rich; but I am alone in
the world, and can afford to indulge my taste.
Your husband is an artist, and I am come to
command a picture from him.  I leave the
subject, size, and price, entirely to him.  Let him
execute whatever his genius prompts him; and
I am quite sure I shall be the gainer by leaving
the price to him.  Meanwhile, as you are not
in flourishing circumstances, here is a cheque
for fifty pounds, on account.  When he wants
more, he knows where to apply."
</p>

<p>
He placed a cheque in her hand as he said
this.  She understood but too well this
delicate mode of assisting them, and a tear rose
into her eye as she pressed his hand
significantly: she could not speak.  He embraced
her child repeatedly, and, with a fond protecting
look, bade her good-bye.
</p>

<p>
Left alone, she burst into tears: they were
tears of gratitude and tears of shame: gratitude
for the beautiful and delicate friendship of the
act and its manner: shame at finding herself
reduced to such a state, that she was forced
to accept alms from her former lover.
</p>

<p>
As she grew calmer, the thought rose within
her, that perhaps this might be the saving of
Cecil&mdash;that he, finding employment, might
resolutely set to work, and&mdash;no longer forced to
seek a subsistence by gaming,&mdash;resume his
honourable career.
</p>

<p>
Building cloud-castles on the landscape of
the future, she was light and joyous when
Cecil returned, and flung herself upon his neck,
with almost frantic delight.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
HUMBLED PRIDE.
</h3>

<p>
Cecil received those demonstrations of joy
with moody sullenness.  He had returned
exasperated by failure, gloomy with the dark
thoughts which lowered upon him, like heavy
clouds collected over the sunny fields, boding
a coming storm.
</p>

<p>
"Blanche," he said, "we are beggars."
</p>

<p>
The smile was still upon her face; she pushed
the hair gently from off his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"There is no hope left.  I have tried every body."
</p>

<p>
"I have had a visitor, darling, since you
went out.  Guess who it was."
</p>

<p>
"Julius?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Your father?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"A dun?"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Heath."
</p>

<p>
"The devil it was!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I thought it would surprise you.  Oh!
I was so happy to see him!"
</p>

<p>
"Heath... here!" exclaimed Cecil, his cheek
burning as he spoke.  "And you saw him? ... received
him here ... and in my absence?  You
did?"
</p>

<p>
"Was I wrong?" she, trembling, asked.
</p>

<p>
"Wrong?  Oh, no; it was not wrong to
receive your lover.  You needn't start ... he is
your lover, and you know it!  You know,
moreover, that I hate him... The scoundrel!
And he saw you here ... here, in this beggarly
place ... in this hole of poverty!  And he
triumphed over me ... triumphed because his
prophecy was fulfilled!  Didn't he, too, urge
you to leave me?  Didn't he, too, tell you I
was a villain, dragging you to ruin?  Didn't
he offer to take you home? .... Speak! don't
stare at me in that way!  Tell me all the
scoundrel said ... quick!"
</p>

<p>
"Cecil, Cecil, down on your knees, and beg
his pardon for having so slandered him!  You
are not in your senses to speak so&mdash;and of
him, of him!"
</p>

<p>
"Slandered him, have I?  What! the
sneaking wretch who takes advantage of my present
situation...."
</p>

<p>
"To assist <i>you</i>!" indignantly exclaimed
Blanche.
</p>

<p>
"Assist <i>me!</i> and for what <i>purpose</i>?  For
whose sake&mdash;for mine?  No; for yours!  Oh!
I see all his plans&mdash;I see them all!"
</p>

<p>
Cecil, mad with jealousy and rage, dashed
his hand upon the table, and swore a fearful
oath.  It was not that he for a moment
suspected his wife; but he had never been able to
overcome his jealousy of Heath; and what
added tenfold torture to that venomous feeling
now, was the thought that Heath had come
back to find Blanche reduced to want&mdash;to find
her in this miserable lodging deprived of all the
comforts and necessaries of life.  He felt
himself horribly humiliated in the eyes of his hated
rival; he felt that his rival triumphed over his
degradation; and he dreaded lest Blanche
should have made an involuntary comparison
between her present condition, and what it
would have been had she married Heath.  All
this rapidly crossed his mind, and drove him
to fury.
</p>

<p>
"Cecil," she said, struggling with her tears,
"you are unhappy, and that makes you unjust.
If you but knew the noble nature of him...."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Hold your tongue!  Am I to sit here and
listen to <i>his</i> praises?  Noble nature, indeed!
Yes, yes, I know it....  I know it."
</p>

<p>
"Then you know...."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, I say!  Are you going to draw a
comparison between us?  Are you going to
contrast his virtues with my vices?  A good
subject, but a bold one for a wife to touch
upon!"
</p>

<p>
"Cecil, you break my heart...  Will you hear me?"
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"What have I said or done...."
</p>

<p>
"You have received, during my absence, a
man I hate&mdash;a man who, if he again crosses my
threshold, I will throw out of the window."
</p>

<p>
"Look at this!" she said, presenting the
cheque to him.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?"
</p>

<p>
"If you will not listen to me, trust your own
eyes."
</p>

<p>
"A cheque for fifty pounds&mdash;and from <i>him</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"He came here to command a picture; you
are to name your own price; that is on
account."
</p>

<p>
Cecil took the cheque, looked at it, and
then at her.
</p>

<p>
"And do you believe this?" he said, with
intense calmness.  "Do you really believe that
he wants a picture?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I believe that to be an excuse...."
</p>

<p>
"An excuse!  By God! she knows it!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a delicate way of assisting us.&mdash;That
is the conduct of the man whom you have
outraged by your suspicions."
</p>

<p>
Cecil was stupefied.  Her perception of the
subterfuge quite staggered him.
</p>

<p>
"So, so&mdash;he thinks to <i>buy</i> you, does he?"
he at last said, choking with rage.
</p>

<p>
She coloured deeply with shame, and exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cecil!  Cecil!"
</p>

<p>
"Well then, to buy <i>me</i>!  He thinks I am to be
<i>patronized</i>.... to be his workman.... to receive
his orders.... to receive his money!  Blanche,
this cheque is either an outrage to you, or an
insult to me.  Don't speak! .... Not another
word."
</p>

<p>
He rose, and put on his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!  Cecil, what are you about to do?"
</p>

<p>
"To find out this liberal patron."
</p>

<p>
"Cecil, Cecil! do be calm!"
</p>

<p>
"I am.  I will fling this cheque in his
odious face, and tell him what I think."
</p>

<p>
She threw herself upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Cecil! my own darling! listen to your
Blanche....  For God's sake, be calm! ... Think
of me; think of your child! .... A duel! oh,
Cecil! could you leave your child fatherless,
Cecil?"
</p>

<p>
He flung her from him, and rushed out of
the house: she reeled and fell.  The child
began to scream; the old lady living in the
parlours hurried up stairs, and found Blanche
lifeless on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Like a madman, Cecil bounded along the
streets, goaded by one of those irresistible
outbreaks of passion which sometimes mastered
him.  On reaching the house where Heath
formerly lived, and hearing that he no longer
lived there, he remembered Heath having just
returned from abroad, and that his residence
could only be known at his bankers.  Thither
he went: on his way he passed through
Jermyn-street.  It was in that street was kept the
gaming-house where he had spent so many of
his days and nights.
</p>

<p>
A new direction was given to his thoughts:
insensibly they left the subject of Captain
Heath to merge into that of play.  Still he
walked on, but less swiftly.  The idea of the
splendid martingale he had recently discovered,
which this fifty pounds would enable him to
play, would not leave him.
</p>

<p>
He walked more and more slowly.  Fifty
pounds&mdash;it might make his fortune.
</p>

<p>
After all, Heath might possibly have desired
a picture.  The fool! as if he knew anything
about pictures&mdash;he, the heavy guardsman,
purchase pictures!
</p>

<p>
Yet, if he was rich, that was one way of
spending his money.  There was nothing but
what was perfectly legitimate in an artist
receiving a commission;&mdash;all artists receive
them.
</p>

<p>
And with this fifty pounds a fortune was
within his grasp.
</p>

<p>
He no longer walked, he crawled.
This money was certainly his, if he chose
to take it; why should he refuse?  To be
sure, the money of that scoundrel!  All
an excuse, too: Blanche knew it was an excuse.
</p>

<p>
He quickened his pace again.  He was at
the banking-house: he pushed the door, and
entered.
</p>

<p>
"I can return him the money to-morrow.  I
will say Blanche changed it.  Out of my
winnings I can repay it."
</p>

<p>
He handed the cheque to the cashier.
</p>

<p>
"How will you take it, sir?" demanded the
cashier.
</p>

<p>
"Gold," was the brief answer.
</p>

<p>
His eyes sparkled as the fifty sovereigns were
shovelled across the counter; and he left the
bank with lights dancing before him.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
"BLACK WINS."
</h3>

<p>
The fascination of the gaming-table was too
much for him; all his sense of dignity vanished
before it; even his very jealous rage seemed
thus powerless against it.  Humiliated as he
felt at the idea of accepting charity from
his rival, he could not reject it when it came
to feed his passion for play.  Although he had
not a farthing in the house, although utter
destitution threatened him, he would not, to save
himself from it, have accepted Heath's assistance;
but he could accept it when it enabled
him to play.
</p>

<p>
To one of his old haunts he went.  The first
man he saw there was the large-whiskered,
jovial, and eccentric gentleman whom he had
noticed on the second evening: of his entering
a house of play: he had since lost sight of
him.  The little man stroked his bushy whiskers
fondly over his face, and, offering Cecil a
pinch of snuff, expressed his pleasure at
meeting him again.
</p>

<p>
"Come to try the goddess, sir?" he inquired.
"Fickle goddess! now smiling, now frowning&mdash;quite
a <i>woman</i>!  I am no great hand <i>myself</i>;
but, as far as a few crowns go, I find it a
<i>pleasant game</i>&mdash;decidedly pleasant.  Would you
like to <i>regulate</i> yourself by my <i>card</i>?&mdash;duly
<i>pricked</i>, you see.  There have been three runs
upon the black; once it turned up eleven times.
Shall we take a glass of <i>wine</i> together?
Yes;&mdash;waiter! some <i>wine</i>."
</p>

<p>
"No wine for me, thank you; I never touch
it before dinner.  Have you seen Mr. Forrester
here to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"The gentleman with the large moustachios?&mdash;Yes;
he has been playing, and won; but he
went away about a quarter of an hour <i>ago</i>."
</p>

<p>
Cecil took his seat at the table.  Gambling
by day has, somehow, a more hideous aspect
than by night: I suppose because it looks so
little like an amusement, and so much like
a mere affair of cupidity.  But Cecil had
grown used to this, as to other loathsome
aspects of his vice, and sat down to the
table with as much <i>sang froid</i> as if he were
about to transact the most ordinary piece of
business.
</p>

<p>
He had not been playing long, winning and
losing in pretty equal succession, when Frank
came back.
</p>

<p>
"What, again!" said Cecil.  "I thought
you had gone for the day: I heard you had
departed with your winnings."
</p>

<p>
"The fact is, that I found my winnings
rapidly decreasing, so I thought a little interval
might very properly elapse; after which fortune
again might be on my side.  Besides, old boy,
you must know that I haven't dined for eight
days;&mdash;and when I say dined, I don't mean
dining in the true sense, but in the common,
vulgar, <i>pauper</i> sense of the word.  I have
made no meal which could <i>represent</i> a dinner.
For eight days I haven't touched meat, damn
my whiskers!  So, being as ravenous as a
hyena, I determined that to-day, at least, I
<i>would</i> dine."
</p>

<p>
"And have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Have I, Cis?  Why it's not yet five: do
you imagine that under <i>any</i> circumstance I
could lower myself so far as to dine at the
shopkeeper's hour?  No, damn it! one may be
hard up, but one does not forget one is a
gentleman!"
</p>

<p>
"Have you ordered your dinner then?"
</p>

<p>
"More than ordered it&mdash;<i>paid</i> for it.  I
went to the butcher's, and bought two pounds
of magnificent steak: this I carried to a small
Public, hard by, with the strictest injunctions
as to the dressing of it&mdash;saw the cook myself,
and am satisfied she knows what's what.  It is
to be ready at half-past six precisely, with no
end of fried potatoes, and a bottle of their old
crusted, which I know from experience is a
wine that a gentleman can drink.  The dinner
you will say is not epicurean, but at any rate it
is <i>certain</i>, because I have paid for it all.  Now
I don't mind risking the rest of my winnings.
My mind is at rest: the baser appetites are
provided for."
</p>

<p>
He began to play also; and he won.
</p>

<p>
"I told you luck would change," he said.
</p>

<p>
But he soon lost again, and lost repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, I have secured a dinner for
to-day, which will last a week."
</p>

<p>
Cecil was equally unfortunate; the run
seemed to be decidedly against him.
</p>

<p>
At last Frank threw down his final half-crown.
It went like the others.  He started
up, and hurried away, without saying good-bye;
indeed, giving no other expression of his feelings
than was convoyed in an energetic denunciation
of his whiskers.
</p>

<p>
Cecil played on; and as he saw the sovereigns
disappear in spite of his famous martingale,
his heart sank within him, and the gloom
of despair seemed to paralyse his mind.
Suffering horrible agony from the intense excitement
of each coup, he yet played mechanically, almost
listlessly, he lost, and won, and lost again,
with fearful alternation of sick despair and dull
joy.  It was as if he were staking his heart's
blood on each turn.
</p>

<p>
Frank returned, not without a certain hilarity
in his manner.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you been?" Cecil faintly inquired.
</p>

<p>
"To my worthy host of the Coach and
Horses, at whose house my dinner is
commanded.  It struck me that I could very well
dispense with wine to-day&mdash;the more so as it
costs six shillings a bottle, and here one gets it
for nothing&mdash;so I negociated with the worthy
publican, and sold him the wine back again for
two half-crowns.  Here they are.  What d'ye
think of that?  Is that management of financial
difficulties, eh?"
</p>

<p>
A sickly smile was the only answer Cecil
gave, for at that moment he had just lost his
fourth <i>coup</i> running.  The two half-crowns
seemed to bring back Frank's luck, for he won
rapidly; Cecil, who played the same colours,
also won.  Winning and losing, and losing and
winning, so the game went on, with alternate
rising and falling of hopes, and in the rapidity
with which small gains mounted up to large
sums, and those sums dwindled down again,
crowding as much excitement as would have
filled a month of ordinary life.
</p>

<p>
"Done! cleaned out!" exclaimed Frank, as
he saw himself once more penniless.
</p>

<p>
A sharp pang shot across Cecil's face, as he
threw down his last sovereign on the red.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Après</i>," said the dealer.
</p>

<p>
Cecil had now only ten shillings remaining of
the fifty pounds.  In breath-suspended agony
he watched the cards.
</p>

<p>
"Red wins!" said the dealer.
</p>

<p>
He breathed again, and looked round to smile
at Frank; but that worthy had again departed
to negociate the sale of his dinner.
</p>

<p>
Yes; this dinner, so cherished, so anticipated,
paid for in advance, on which the imagination
had luxuriated as on a kingly banquet;
this dinner was sold for a miserable trifle, that
he might risk one more coup at that table where
so many men had ruined themselves before!
</p>

<p>
Cecil continued in luck until Frank returned;
this time with no hilarity on his face, but a
quiet gravity, which seemed prepared for the
worst; and when he lost the last shilling he
broke out into a short, sharp, hysterical laugh,
and turning to Cecil, said with forced calmness,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I shall not dine to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant <i>game</i> this, sir," said the
bushy-whiskered gentleman, coming up to where
Frank sat, "take a pinch of <i>snuff</i>, sir?"  Frank
accepted with grace, and began chatting
with the smiling gentleman, who was very
communicative, and informed Frank that he
had that afternoon won no less than ten
half-crowns by backing the red.
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, sir," said Frank, "red <i>is</i> the
colour."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt about it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes.  By the way, you haven't a half-crown
about you at this minute, have you?  I
am cleared out for the day."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I certainly have <i>such</i> a thing, but..."
</p>

<p>
"Say no more, my dear fellow," said Frank,
shaking him warmly by the hand, "half a
crown will be abundance, I only want to try the
red once.  I'm really obliged to you for the
offer of the loan, and shall accept it with
pleasure.  Now-a-days one does not often meet
with such a trump!  If ever you should run
low, you know, in me you will always find one
ready to reciprocate a civility."
</p>

<p>
The smiling gentleman rubbed his whiskers
and filled his nose with snuff; but he concluded
by slipping the half-crown into Frank's hand,
who instantly threw it on the red.
</p>

<p>
Cecil had thrown his last five pounds upon
the red, and with straining eyeballs watched
the falling cards.
</p>

<p>
"Black wins," said the dealer.
</p>

<p>
Frank saw the croupier rake away his
half-crown, and with it Cecil's five pounds.
</p>

<p>
A low cry burst from Cecil, as he learned
his fate; and, leaning his elbows on the table,
he let his head fall into his hands, and sobbed
aloud.
</p>

<p>
The dealers and croupiers, accustomed to
every expression of grief, sat with immoveable,
expressionless faces, pursuing their routine with
an indifference which was quite ghastly.  The
players looked upon him with different
feelings: some with compassion, some with
contempt, some with sympathetic fear.  But above
his wretched sobs were heard the unvarying
tones of, "Gentlemen, make your game; the
game is made."
</p>

<p>
Frank touched Cecil on the shoulder, and
beckoned him to come away.  Mechanically
Cecil did so, and they stepped together out
into the dull, dismal, November evening, and
walked through the mist and lightly falling
snow, without uttering a word.
</p>

<p>
At Park Lane they parted; a pressure of
the hand was the only expression of their
feelings which passed between them.  Sick at
heart, they both felt that nothing could be said
to comfort them.
</p>

<p>
The lights glimmered dimly through the dirty
air of that November evening, and the snow
fell, and the rain, and the whole scene was
drear and desolate, as Cecil wandered on,
crushed in spirit, savage from remorse,
exasperated by his impotent efforts to shake off
the galling remembrance that he was now
Heath's debtor&mdash;that he had taken his money,
and could not throw it back at him.
</p>

<p>
Wild thoughts of suicide chased across his
soul, like dancing lights over a bleak moor at
night; but they did not long abide with him.

CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
CECIL'S WEAKNESS.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  O God!  O God! that it were possible<br>
  To undo things done,&mdash;to call back yesterday!<br>
  That Time could turn his swift and sandy glass<br>
  To untell days, or to redeem these hours!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEYWOOD.&mdash;<i>A Woman Killed with Kindness.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Blanche returned to her senses, she
found herself in the arms of her landlady, who
was bathing her forehead with vinegar and water.
</p>

<p>
"My husband!" she murmured; "where is
my husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's not come back yet.  There, you
are better now, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you; yes, I can walk now."
</p>

<p>
"Don't attempt it just yet."
</p>

<p>
"I must.  I must go out."
</p>

<p>
"Go out such a day as this!  Why, see
how it snows."
</p>

<p>
"I must.  You see I can stand.  Oh, pray
God, I may not be too late."
</p>

<p>
"But where do you wish to go, my dear?
Can't I send my girl for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Where?  Where?  Ay, indeed.  He did
not tell me where.  But then Cecil will not
know where to find .... Thank God!  Thank
God!"
</p>

<p>
She sank down again upon the chair, relieved
of her terrible anxiety; for she doubted not
that if Cecil were unable to meet with Captain
Heath, he would soon grow calmer, and look
at things more rationally.
</p>

<p>
She waited for his return, however, with
extreme uneasiness, fearful lest he should not
have missed the captain; and dreading lest he
should still continue his jealous suspicions.
Free from all sentiment of jealousy herself, she
could not understand Cecil's excessive
susceptibility; and knowing Captain Heath so well
as she did, she was perfectly convinced that
her husband's jealousy was quite motiveless.
This made her feel secure on this subject.
Her deep sense of her own innocence, and of
Heath's high-mindedness, made her convinced
that Cecil must see the matter in its true
light, so soon as he should calmly consider it.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly seven o'clock before her anxiety
was relieved by hearing his knock at the door;
but she screamed with terror as he entered the
room.  Although his coat and hat were covered
with snow, he had left his chest exposed to the
cold, and his shirt-collar and front were
dripping with wet.  He had evidently been
altogether heedless of his person, and had given
no thought of protecting it from the weather.
</p>

<p>
His face was pale and haggard, his eyes dull
and blood-shot, his lips compressed&mdash;his whole
aspect that of one who has just committed
some fearful crime.  She interrogated his face
with watchful terror.  He avoided her eye.
</p>

<p>
He seated himself in silence, and began brushing
the snow off his hat.  That completed, he
placed his wet feet on the fender, and looked
stedfastly at the fire.
</p>

<p>
Unable to bear this suspense, she went up to
him, and laying her hand upon his shoulder,
said timidly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen him?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
She felt greatly relieved.  He continued to
look at the fire, but gave no signs of wishing to
prolong the conversation.  She drew a stool by
his side, and sat down upon it; and in silence
they both contemplated the evanescent shapes
in the burning coals.
</p>

<p>
Having sat thus for some time, Blanche rose
and went into the next room, and presently
returned with her baby in her arms, asleep, which
she gently laid upon Cecil's lap.
</p>

<p>
He turned a dull, sad eye upon her, inquiringly,
and then looked down upon the sleeping
infant on his knee.
</p>

<p>
"Unhappy child!" he said, and the tears
rolled down his cheeks, as he gazed upon the
sleeping babe, unconscious of the sorrow it
awakened in its father's heart, and the remorse
for infatuated villany, the consequences of which
must eventually fall upon its head.
</p>

<p>
"Take her away," he said, "take her away.
Why do you bring her to me?"
</p>

<p>
"To make you happy."
</p>

<p>
"To make me more miserable than I was
before&mdash;to reproach me&mdash;me, her father, that
she has not a better home, warmer clothing!
Take her away."
</p>

<p>
Blanche, sobbing, took the child and laid it
again in its cradle.
</p>

<p>
"Blanche you must write a note for me," he
said, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"To whom, dearest?"
</p>

<p>
No reply.
</p>

<p>
"To whom am I to write?"
</p>

<p>
"To&mdash;Captain Heath!" he said, with an effort.
</p>

<p>
She started at the name, alarmed and wondering.
</p>

<p>
"What am I to say?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you please&mdash;you are sure to succeed."
</p>

<p>
"But tell me what the object is?"
</p>

<p>
"Money."
</p>

<p>
"Money?"
</p>

<p>
"For my picture&mdash;I am to paint him one,
am I not? he has ordered it.  Well!  I want
money in advance."
</p>

<p>
Blanche would have been highly delighted
at such a speech, had it been uttered in
a different tone, and had not Captain Heath,
already, that very day, given a cheque in
advance.
</p>

<p>
She made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Well!" he said, "are you ready?  Write
it at once."
</p>

<p>
"But the fifty pounds...."
</p>

<p>
"Gone!  I met a man to whom I owed it&mdash;he
demanded payment&mdash;I was forced to let him
have the cheque.  You can explain it all to
Heath, and tell him I must have ten pounds
more to buy materials with.  Tell him what you
please, but get the money."
</p>

<p>
He resumed his contemplation of the fire
after this speech, and scarcely opened his lips
again for the evening.  Blanche wrote the letter,
but it was with loathing, and she hated herself
while she was doing it, and was sure Captain
Heath would also hate her.
</p>

<p>
Glad as she would have been to see her husband
relinquish his absurd jealousy of the captain,
it came with quite a different aspect when
that relinquishment was not a matter of conviction,
but of degraded calculation.  She guessed
at once the truth of the whole history; she saw
that Cecil had gambled away the fifty pounds,
and that he had not only reconciled himself to
it, but had made up his mind to extort from the
generosity of the captain certain sums which
would enable him to indulge his unhappy passion.
</p>

<p>
What a situation for a loving wife!  Never
before, not even in his worst exhibitions of
selfishness and weakness, had Blanche despised
her husband; but she could not master the
feeling now; a lurking sense of contempt would
intrude itself upon her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
The letter was sent under cover to her father.
</p>

<p>
All the next day Cecil sat over the fire,
sometimes whistling, but mostly quite silent.
He was playing over again the games which he
had lost on the previous day: and <i>now</i>, as he
played them, he calculated rightly, and always
won.
</p>

<p>
Blanche observed that he exhibited singular
impatience for the arrival of the postman; and
when the day entirely passed over without
bringing a letter, he constantly muttered to
himself, "Very extraordinary!"
</p>

<p>
The next morning his impatience was greater,
and when the two o'clock postman brought a
letter for her from Rose, and nothing from
Captain Heath, he began to swear and mutter
to himself, till she was quite terrified.
</p>

<p>
He took up his hat and lounged out, without
saying a word as to where he was going.
</p>

<p>
About three, Captain Heath called.  Blanche
was frightened lest Cecil should return and find
him there; and was also alarmed at the probable
storm which would burst upon her in
consequence of this visit.
</p>

<p>
Heath saw her embarrassment, and attributed
it to a sense of shame at her husband's conduct;
for the note was so incoherently written, that he
divined pretty nearly the whole truth of the
matter.
</p>

<p>
"I have brought a cheque for your husband,"
he said, "because I did not wish to trust it to
the post&mdash;also, because I wished to say a word
to you.  Blanche, I take the privilege of an
old, a very old friend, to speak frankly to you;
therefore, you must not be offended with me
when I ask you to receive another ten pounds
in advance for the picture, besides the cheque
which your husband has requested.  I mean
the second sum to be received by you, for
household expenses&mdash;to be kept a secret by
you&mdash;you can keep a secret from your husband,
can you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you wish it?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, Blanche, affairs are not in a
flourishing condition with you at present; and
as your husband owes a good deal of money,
perhaps, if he knew you had this sum, instead
of allowing it to be devoted to your immediate
necessities, he might also play that away."
</p>

<p>
She blushed deeply, as she perceived that he
had guessed the truth.
</p>

<p>
"I wish, therefore, that you would give him
this cheque from me, which he has asked, but
that you would say nothing, if you can help
it, about the other sum.  I am asking, perhaps,
that which I ought not to ask.  I am overstepping,
perhaps, the bounds of friendship,
and interfering in domestic concerns where I
have no sort of right to interfere.  But it is my
friendship which dictates the wish, and which
must be my excuse.  I do not bind you to any
condition; I do not even wish you to keep the
matter a secret, if it is at all repugnant to your
feelings: but I would strenuously <i>advise</i> you
to do so.  Act just as you think fitting and
proper; do not imagine that I wish in any way
to dictate to you; but, as a brother might
counsel you, I would venture to suggest, that
on many accounts it would be well if you did
not speak of this."
</p>

<p>
"Kindest, best of men!" she exclaimed,
pressing his hand.  She could say no more.
</p>

<p>
He quietly laid the cheque upon the mantelpiece,
and slipped ten sovereigns into the
pocket of her apron.  He then, to change the
subject, asked after Rose Blanche, who was
brought to him immediately.
</p>

<p>
Blanche, after a long struggle with herself,
at last said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Captain Heath, you know me well enough
to believe that I am neither insensible to your
friendship, nor ungrateful for it&mdash;do you not?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly, dear Blanche."
</p>

<p>
"And if I were to say anything to you that
might look ungrateful, you would not believe
that it sprang from ingratitude? you would at
once see that I was forced by circumstances,
not by my own will?"
</p>

<p>
He shook slightly, as he answered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I could not doubt you."
</p>

<p>
"You do not believe me to be capricious?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not."
</p>

<p>
"And if I were to beg you .... to .... if I
were to say.... do not come here any more....?"
</p>

<p>
Her voice faltered, and died away in a whisper.
He started as the words fell on his ear,
and turned first red, then pale again.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of embarrassed silence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! do not believe," she passionately
exclaimed, "that it comes from me; do not
fancy that I should ever....  But I cannot do what
my heart dictates: I owe obedience to another."
</p>

<p>
He saw at once what was in her mind; he
saw that Cecil's absurd jealousy was at the
bottom of her agitation: and in a low but firm
tone, he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Blanche, do not continue.  I understand
you.  I never was a favourite of his, and he
naturally enough does not desire my acquaintance;
in which case, of course, I must relinquish
the pleasure of seeing you.  Do not sob,
Blanche&mdash;you cannot help this.  Such cases are
frequent.  I shall not regard you less&mdash;shall
not be less your friend, because I am not
permitted to see you.  Perhaps, if he knew me
better, he might think otherwise of me; but
sympathy is not to be commanded, and too
many people dislike me, for me to be either
surprised or hurt at his opinion.  Besides, I
have already interfered too much between you.
He thinks my conduct unwarrantable&mdash;perhaps
it was&mdash;and he dislikes me.  There, you see I
look at the matter in its true light.  I do not
blame you&mdash;I do not blame him.  A husband
is not forced to accept the friends of his
wife."
</p>

<p>
At this moment Cecil returned.
</p>

<p>
Heath coloured as he saw him enter the
room; Blanche turned aside her head to
conceal her tears, but not before Cecil's glance
had detected them; a fierce pain shot across
Cecil's heart, as if a burning iron had entered
it, but with a hypocritical smile he extended
his hand to the captain, and expressed himself
delighted to see him.
</p>

<p>
The situation was excessively uncomfortable
for all three.  The captain could not depart, it
would have looked so pointed, yet to remain
was torture.  Blanche was terrified, and silent.
Cecil, who in an instant saw that Heath's
presence betokened a fresh assistance from him,
stifled the horrible jealousy which his presence
awakened, and resolved not to lose the benefit.
He began a common-place conversation, and
soon led it to the subject of the commissioned
picture, for which he declared he had been
inspired with a magnificent idea.
</p>

<p>
Heath's replies were brief and cold; but
Cecil was not to be daunted.  So completely
had his vice corrupted him, that he had lost all
sense of dignity, and only looked upon the
captain as a victim from whom to draw sums of
money.  That Heath loved his wife he knew;
and doubted not but that from such an affection
he should draw golden results.  That Blanche
did not return the captain's love, he was firmly
convinced&mdash;and yet that conviction could not
allay his jealousy.  Awful moral perplexity and
corruption!  Despicable weakness and meanness!
Here was a man base enough to barter
his honour, yet not strong enough to resist the
petty irritation of the pettiest jealousy!
</p>

<p>
As the captain took his leave, Cecil said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We are generally at home,&mdash;if you should
be in this neighbourhood, pray don't forget to
give us a look in.  It is but a miserable place
to come to&mdash;but old friends, you know."
</p>

<p>
Blanche's eye met the captain's, and most
significantly expressed,&mdash;"Don't accept the
invitation."
</p>

<p>
Heath merely bowed his acceptance, and
departed, marvelling much whether it was
corruption or irony which dictated Cecil's
speech.
</p>

<p>
Cecil made no observation to Blanche
respecting the captain's presence; but took up
the cheque with delight, and forthwith proceeded
to get it cashed, and to carry the money
to Leicester-square, whence, after spending the
afternoon and night at play, with various
alternations of fortune, he came away a winner of
thirteen pounds.
</p>

<p>
He was in excellent spirits on his return
home.  Blanche said nothing respecting the ten
sovereigns in her possession.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
ALL HOPE DESTROYED.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Although the life of a gamester is full of
emotion, full of successes and reverses, the
incidents are all so very similar that I need not
enter into more details.  Suffice it, that Cecil
made such frequent applications to Captain
Heath, that a point blank refusal came at last;
much to Blanche's satisfaction, for she deeply
felt the humiliation of seeing him plundered in
that shameless way to feed the gaming-table.
She knew that it was for her sake Heath gave
the money; and she knew that it only added
fresh fuel to her husband's unhappy passion.
</p>

<p>
The last few weeks had completely banished
from her heart all hope of an amendment.  Not
only had Cecil shamelessly applied to Heath for
money in advance on a picture which he had
made no attempt even to commence; but he
had, by one act, opened her eyes to the extent
of his reckless infatuation.
</p>

<p>
It was about a fortnight after Captain Heath's
visit, when, as Cecil sat in his usual attitude
over the fire, indolently smoking a cigar,
Blanche said to him,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"When are you going to paint that picture,
dearest, which you have engaged for?"
</p>

<p>
"In good time."
</p>

<p>
"But why not do it at once?"
</p>

<p>
"He did not stipulate that it was to be done
at once, did he?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but there can be no reason why you
should not do it.  You have nothing else in
hand.  Besides, when that is finished you can
paint another; and you know how badly we
want money."
</p>

<p>
"Badly enough, God knows!"
</p>

<p>
"I do not like to accept the advances he
makes us, when I see you not working at the
picture."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!"
</p>

<p>
"You must do it sooner or later; why not
now?  Come, Cecil, make an effort&mdash;begin it."
</p>

<p>
"Begin when I haven't even money to buy
the necessary materials.  Write to him and
tell him I have a splendid subject, but that
really&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That is unnecessary.  I have money&mdash;I
will go and get you all you want."
</p>

<p>
"You, Blanche!  And where did you get
money from?'
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," she replied playfully.  "Perhaps
it was a little fairy.  Enough that I have
some."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm not curious; so that you have
got money, that is all I care about.  How
much?"
</p>

<p>
"There again!  Not curious!  Why, you
are as curious as a woman.  Don't inquire."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Get me the things, that's all."
</p>

<p>
She went into the next room, and he heard
her unlock a drawer.  He continued calmly
smoking; she put on her bonnet and tripped
down stairs.
</p>

<p>
No sooner did he hear the street door shut
than he rose and walked into her bed-room to
search for the money.  He saw a drawer with a
key in it, but on opening it he found nothing
there.  He next unlocked all the other drawers,
but without result.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing now in the room likely to
conceal any money, and he began to think that
perhaps she had only a few shillings, which she
had carried away with her.  Almost mechanically
he opened the small drawer of her wash-hand
stand, and there he saw six sovereigns
glittering in the farther corner.  His face
lighted up with a strange expression as they
met his eye, and rapidly clutching them, and
turning over the drawer to see if it concealed
any more, he took his hat, and was out of the
house in an instant.
</p>

<p>
When Blanche returned and found him gone,
her heart misgave her; with trembling limbs she
staggered into the bed-room&mdash;opened the
drawer&mdash;and saw her fears confirmed.  It is impossible
to render the despair which seized her at
this discovery.  That little incident was more
frightful to her, was more damning evidence of
the unconquerable nature of his vice than any
she had yet known; and helpless, hopeless she
sank upon the bed, not to weep, but to brood
upon the awful prospect of her life.
</p>

<p>
It was not grief which laid her prostrate, it
was a stupor: a dull, heavy agony, like a
shroud closing her from life, from hope, from
happiness.  Before, her heart had been wrung;
she had been humiliated, she had been tortured;
but in the bitterest moments, she had never
been utterly prostrate,&mdash;never absolutely
without gleam of hope.  Now, her husband stood
before her as irreclaimable,&mdash;marching with
frightful rapidity to his doom, and dragging
with him, a wife and child.
</p>

<p>
That child's cries on awaking, partly
aroused her.  She felt the necessity for an
effort; she felt that another demanded she
should not give way to the stupor which
oppressed her.  She put the child to her breast;
but, alas! the shock she had received had dried
up its life-giving fountains, and the disappointed
infant sucked in vain.  Tears gushed
from her, as she became aware of this new
misfortune&mdash;tears, scalding yet refreshing tears,
which melted down her stubborn grief into
something more like human woe; and relieved
by them, she rose to make some food for the
hungry babe, whose impatient cries recalled her
to a sense of duties, which allowed not the
passive indulgence of sorrow.  Cecil, meanwhile,
had lost the little treasure he had
obtained possession of in so despicable a manner;
and having lost it, remained sauntering about
the streets, without courage to return home to
face his wife.  Exhausted at last by fatigue, he
came back.
</p>

<p>
Not a word passed between them.  He got
into bed feeling humbled and exasperated, yet
not having courage even to put a bullying
face on the matter.  She was brushing her
hair, and he heard the sighs which she
struggled to suppress, but he feigned sleep, and
<i>would not</i> hear them.
</p>

<p>
She crept into bed, anxious not to awake
him; and through the long night he heard her
weeping, so that it almost broke his heart: yet
he feigned sleep, and dared not speak!
</p>

<p>
From that time, there was always a sort
of barrier between them.  A wall had grown
up between their loves, formed out of shame,
remorse, pity and hopelessness.  They never
alluded to the incident which caused it; but
they both felt that it was constantly present in
each other's minds.
</p>

<p>
Their existence was wretched indeed.  Vyner
and Julius took care that Blanche should want
for no necessities&mdash;food, clothing, little articles
of necessity were all regularly sent in by
them; and the rent was paid by Vyner
himself.  But no more money could Cecil extort
from them on any pretext.  They knew well
enough, that to give him money was only to
give him opportunities of playing, and so
they limited their charity to seeing that Blanche
and her child, were not in absolute want.
</p>

<p><a id="chap0808"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
THE FORGERY.
</h3>

<p>
One day as Cecil was sauntering down Piccadilly,
he was astonished to see Frank Forrester,
in a superb cab, with tiger behind, drive up to
Burlington Arcade, and there, arrayed in dashing
style, step out as if the lord and master of
three thousand a year, at least.
</p>

<p>
The contrast between his appearance at that
moment, and the last time Cecil had seen him,
when in the final stage of seediness, he had
gambled away even his dinner, so amazed
Cecil, that he rubbed his eyes as one awaking
from a dream.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Cis, my boy, how are you?" said
Frank, grasping him by the hand.  "Why,
you're quite a stranger.&mdash;I am so glad to see
you.  Flourishing now, damn my whiskers!
flourishing, Cis, as you perceive.  Nobby style,
eh?  Correct thing that, I hope."
</p>

<p>
"Quite&mdash;But whence this change?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! tell you that presently.  Just step up
the arcade with me.&mdash;I'm only going to look
in upon Jeffs, to see if Paul de Kock's last
novel has arrived, and then command me."
</p>

<p>
He put his arm within Cecil's, and marched
up the arcade, playing with an elegant watch-chain
which drooped from his waistcoat button,
and winking at every woman they passed.
</p>

<p>
When they turned into Jeffs' shop, that
worthy bibliopole, albeit accustomed daily to a
strange variety of customers, from noblemen
and their flunkies, to dingy, sallow, foreigners,
redolent of garlic, and bearded like pards,
opened his eyes at such a strange apparition
as the resplendent, insolent Frank, arm in
arm with the careworn, battered, shabby,
Cecil.
</p>

<p>
"Paul de Kock arrived yet?" said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," replied Jeffs, "but we expect our
case to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I think your to-morrow never arrives&mdash;at
any rate, your case doesn't arrive with it.  Is
your case a pleasing fiction, or a reality?"
</p>

<p>
"It will be here to-morrow, sir, I have no
doubt.  In fact I expected it yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, send me up Paul de Kock the
instant you get it; will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Cis, my boy."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite a <i>grand seigneur</i>, I perceive,
Frank," said Cecil, as they strolled out of the
shop.  "Cab&mdash;tiger&mdash;chains&mdash;French novels&mdash;have
you come into an inheritance?"
</p>

<p>
"Something like it, but jump into my cab,
and I'll tell you all about it."
</p>

<p>
They got in, and Frank, handling the reins
with no small degree of pride, drove into the
Park, and thus explained his present fortune.
</p>

<p>
"The fact is, Cis, I have discovered the true
method of playing.  I broke the bank at
No. 14, last Saturday; and have won no trifle
since.  You see all the martingales yet invented
have some inherent imperfection.  They go
smoothly enough in theory; but damn the
practice, say I!"
</p>

<p>
"Is not yours a martingale, then?'
</p>

<p>
"No: it is simply playing with skill.  To
explain it in a few words: you know that there
are constantly runs upon a colour; sometimes
it is the red, sometimes the black.  You also
know that they dodge about, and that the red
will alternately win and lose every successive
coup.  My plan is to wait quietly while the
game is dodging, and directly I see a run, I
back in heavily.  If the red has turned up
three times, the chances are, that there is to be
a run on that colour, and I back it till it loses.
D'ye understand?'
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly.  But I don't so clearly see how
you must win at it."
</p>

<p>
"Bah&mdash;<i>that's</i> the very best proof!  In every
martingale, don't you on the contrary clearly
see how you must win, but does that prevent
your losing when you begin to play?  So, you
may not see how I must win, but I see how
I do win&mdash;that's enough for me."
</p>

<p>
They dined together that day, and Frank,
who had a box at Drury Lane, proposed that
Cecil should accompany him, but Cecil was
too unwell, and went home brooding on his
friend's prosperity, and playing imaginary
games with fantastic success.
</p>

<p>
All the next day he was moody and irritable.
He would not even notice his child, but walked
up and down his small room, or sat with his
feet on the fender, cowering over the fire, his
head buried in his hands.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening, he wrote to Captain Heath
a hypocritical letter, the object of which was,
as may be expected, to extract a few pounds
from him.  He was less moody after sending
this off; but Blanche observed a strange
wandering in his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
On the morrow he received a cold, firm
answer from the captain, who stated that he
had already advanced as much money on the
picture as he could afford to pay for it, and
that he was therefore forced to refuse.
</p>

<p>
"Damn him!" Cecil muttered, as he read
the letter and crumpled it between his fingers.
</p>

<p>
Blanche guessed the contents by that action;
but she made no remark.
</p>

<p>
For at least an hour did he sit looking fixedly
on the ground, keeping the crumpled letter
in his closed hand; and then she saw him
slowly open it, smooth the paper, and examine
it attentively.  While she was thus watching
his countenance, curious as to what could be
his motive for examining so minutely a
handwriting he knew, he suddenly looked up at her.
A strange expression distorted his face as he
shouted,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What the devil are you looking at me for?"
</p>

<p>
"I ... I ... Cecil..."
</p>

<p>
"You don't suspect anything, do you?" he
fiercely asked.
</p>

<p>
"Suspect, Cecil; and what?"
</p>

<p>
"What's that to you?" he said brusquely,
and again turned away his head.
</p>

<p>
She began to fear that he was getting insane.
</p>

<p>
"Are you not well, dearest?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  Don't bother me!  It must be
near dinner, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Are you hungry?"
</p>

<p>
"Very; go and see about it."
</p>

<p>
She left the room.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes afterwards he was seated at
the table, with Captain Heath's letter before
him, carefully copying the writing, and
comparing his copy with the original.  He smiled
grimly at his own success; and after several
further trials, he forged a check for eighty
pounds, which he had just folded and thrust
into his waistcoat pocket, when Blanche
returned with the dinner.
</p>

<p>
His agitation and the eager manner with
which he caught up some scraps of paper,
and threw them into the fire, did not escape
her.
</p>

<p>
He sat down to dinner, but he could not
swallow a morsel; and his hand shook so, that
he dared not venture to raise it to his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"You are ill, dearest," she said.  "I am
sure you are."
</p>

<p>
"Pooh! it's want of exercise.  I will take
a walk."
</p>

<p>
"Do not go out such weather as this; see
how fast the snow falls."
</p>

<p>
"It won't hurt me.  I must go out."
</p>

<p>
She dared not further interpose; and in a
few minutes he was gone.
</p>

<p>
Left alone, she meditated on the singular
change in his manner&mdash;on his fierceness when
he had observed her watching him&mdash;his
paleness&mdash;his agitation&mdash;and his throwing those
pieces of paper into the fire.
</p>

<p>
She opened his writing-case.  There, among
some loose pieces of blank paper, she found one
with some writing on it.  A film overspread
her eyes, as she recognised in it a copy of
Captain Heath's writing&mdash;so like it, that had
not the characters been traced on a stray slip
of paper, she could never have suspected it to
be other than his writing.
</p>

<p>
Rushing upon her like an overwhelming tide,
came the swift and terrible thoughts which
revealed that her husband had committed a
forgery.  In the desperate hope that she might
not yet be too late to save him from the last
act&mdash;that she might yet meet him at the
banker's and save him&mdash;she threw a shawl
around her, put on her bonnet, and in an
instant she was in a cab driving furiously to
Charing Cross; in her anxiety too much
excited to feel the horror of her situation.
</p>

<p>
As the cab dashed round the corner, by
Charles the First's statue, she saw Cecil hurry
from Messrs. Drummonds' banking-house.  She
saw no more: her brain swam round.  When
the driver opened the cab door, he found her in
a swoon.
</p>

<p>
It did not last long: she recovered herself;
and wildly looking round her, remembered in
an instant all that had passed.
</p>

<p>
"To South Audley Street!" she impatiently
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
To Captain Heath's she drove, and astonished
the servant very much by hurrying up
stairs, and rushing into the room as if life and
death depended on her speed.
</p>

<p>
"Good God, Blanche! what is this?" he
exclaimed, as the half lifeless woman threw
herself speechless into his arms.
</p>

<p>
It was a long time before she could speak;
and even then, in such incoherent sentences
that it was with difficulty Heath understood
what she meant to tell him; but he found that
it was something terrible, and about Cecil; and
he redoubled his attention, trying to piece
together into a coherent narrative, the broken
utterances of this wretched wife.
</p>

<p>
At last he understood her, and tears of deep
compassion stood in his eyes as he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Cheer up, dear Blanche, cheer up!  It is
not so bad after all.  You terrified me at first.
He has only drawn on me in anticipation.  You
know I still owe him money for the picture,&mdash;he
has paid himself,&mdash;he was doubtless close
pressed."
</p>

<p>
"But," she sobbed, "he has forged."
</p>

<p>
"He has been irregular, that is all; he should
have warned me of it.  However, now you have
told me, it is all safe.  Quiet yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that I should have lived for this!"
</p>

<p>
"Courage, courage."
</p>

<p>
"Dishonoured!  My Cecil dishonoured!"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, Blanche.  He has been imprudent,
that is all&mdash;imprudent."
</p>

<p>
"Dishonoured!" she exclaimed, distractedly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you not see, that now I am informed of
what has passed I shall be on my guard?  He
has been imprudent; no one knows it but
ourselves.  You can gently point out to him the
imprudence&mdash;and he is saved.  Only yesterday
I heard of a situation for him in the Colonies&mdash;an
excellent place.  Away from England, he
will have broken from his present connexion,
and lose his unfortunate habits.  A new sphere
will call forth fresh energy.  He may be saved
yet, Blanche; only take courage."
</p>

<p>
She took his hand, and kissed it in mute
thankfulness, but her sobs still tore her bosom,
and all his persuasion could not calm her.
</p>

<p>
Now that she felt the great danger was past,
she had time to feel the immensity of the
blow&mdash;she could grieve.
</p>

<p>
Heath allowed her to weep without trying to
soothe her; for he saw that the great crisis was
over; and silently compassionating the sorrow
of this broken-hearted creature, to dry whose
eyes, he would have sold the world, he sat by
her side holding her hand, from time to time
replying to its convulsive pressure.
</p>

<p>
She rose at last to go home.  He accompanied
her to the door&mdash;saw her take Rose
Blanche from the servant girl, and cover it with
frantic kisses; and then departed sad and
thoughtful to his own solitary home.
</p>

<p>
He could not, in his sympathy with her, forbear
picturing to himself the contrast of what
her fate would have been had she married him
instead of Cecil; nor could he refrain from
bitterly commenting on the truth of his own
prophecies that Cecil would make her unhappy.
No lover ever believes that his beloved can
possibly be happy with his rival; but Heath had
too clearly read Cecil's character, not to feel
assured that, rivalry out of the question, Blanche
was badly matched in wedding one so weak
and selfish.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
RUIN.
</h3>

<p>
In one of the low gambling houses, in Leicester-square,
Cecil sat, as in a dream, risking the
fruits of his crime.  His brain whirled round,
and his heart beat every time the door opened,
for he could not drive away the fear that his
forgery had been detected, and that they were
coming to arrest him.
</p>

<p>
He had dishonoured himself to play this new
game which Frank had explained to him, and
now that the crime was committed he could not
profit by it!
</p>

<p>
Such a game required, above all others,
consummate coolness, and self-mastery; Cecil was
more agitated, his brain was more confused
than ever it had been, and he played utterly at
random.  It would be difficult to conceive
greater torture than that which he endured, for
he won without satisfaction, and lost with
agony; his brain was not so confused but that
he had a distinct perception of his situation,
and of the necessity for playing every <i>coup</i> as
if for life; but at the same time his brain was so
drugged with horror and despair, that his will
seemed paralyzed, and he was forced, as by an
unseen hand, into the ruin which he saw yawning
before him.
</p>

<p>
While the cards were dealt with mechanical
precision by the impassive dealer, and Cecil's
crime-furnished gold was passing away before
his eyes, visions of his happy youth, of his
early days of marriage, and healthy activity,
floated before his mind; and he, the gambler,
on the edge of that dark gulph which gaped
before him, turned back his thoughts to those
sunny days when his soul was stainless, and
his life was full of love and hope, of activity
and happiness; it was like a small wild flower
on a mass of loosening rock, which the next
gust of wind will quite unloosen, and tumble
thundering into the ravine.
</p>

<p>
He thought of his mother, and of her dying
injunctions, and her words of blessing fell upon
his ear, just as the dealer in his passionless
voice proclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Black wins."
</p>

<p>
And a heap of gold was swept away before him.
</p>

<p>
For hours did this tortured gamester play,
becoming gradually inured to the pain he
suffered, and deadened to the whispers of his
conscience.
</p>

<p>
It was now eleven o'clock.  The room was
full of players.  A succession of new faces
replaced those who one by one fell off, contented
with their winnings, or, and this was by far the
most frequent case, desperate from their losses.
But Cecil never moved.  He called for wine
occasionally, but nothing interrupted his play.
</p>

<p>
His last three sovereigns were staked upon
the black: his life was on the hazard of that
one deal.  Even the old players, accustomed to
every species of intense emotion, could not keep
their eyes off Cecil, as with parted lips, straining
eyes, and purple face, he watched the rapid
progress of the game.  Intensely they felt the
moment was supreme.
</p>

<p>
He lost!
</p>

<p>
With a burst of uncontrollable despair, he
snatched the rake from the hand of the croupier,
who had just swept away his money, and
with both hands snapped it in two; a murmur
followed this act of violence, which only seemed
preparatory to something worse; but he glared
round upon the players with such a look of
mad fury that they were awe-stricken.
</p>

<p>
Instead of any further violence, however, he
broke out into a wild hysterical laugh, which
made their blood run cold, and staggered out of
the house.
</p>

<p>
In that moment which had preceded his wild
laugh, a vision of his young wife and child
destitute,&mdash;starving,&mdash;thinned with want and
sickness, had appeared to him, and, as in a flash,
revealed to him the hideous extent of his ruin.
</p>

<p>
Beggared, dishonoured, stained with a profitless
crime, nought remained for him but death;
and in death he resolved to still the throbbing
of his agony.
</p>

<p>
As he stumbled into Leicester Square, he ran
up against one of those unfortunate women,
who, flaunting in satin and faded frippery,
make the streets hideous after sunset.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, my dear, are you going to rush
into my arms without an invitation?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Was ever woman in this humour wooed?<br>
  Was ever woman in this humour won?'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The fumes of bad wine poisoned the breath
of the speaker, but the tones struck so strangely
upon Cecil's ears, that they arrested him even
on the path of death.
</p>

<p>
He seized her by the wrist, and dragged
her under a lamp-post.  As the light fell
upon both their faces, and he recognised in
the wretched woman arrayed in the garb of
shame, the Hester Mason whom he had known
so prosperous and ambitious&mdash;and, as she
recognised in the emaciated haggard wreck
before her, the only man she had ever loved, he
gasped with inexpressible emotion, she wept
with intense shame.
</p>

<p>
Not a word passed between them.  With a
suffocating sense of bitter humiliation, she
wrested herself from his grasp, and darted
down Cranbourne Alley.  He put his hand to
his brow, as if to repress its throbbing, and
slowly walked on.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0810"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE SINNER THAT REPENTETH.
</h3>

<p>
The cause of Hester's degradation was one
which always has, and one fears always will,
people our streets with those unhappy women,
whom the law refuses either to acknowledge or
to suppress&mdash;refuses either to protect or to
punish: a lasting stigma upon our civilization!
</p>

<p>
When Sir Chetsom Chetsom was killed, she
had to look about her for means of subsistence;
and at first imagined that literature would be
an ample field.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the diffusion of knowledge, and to
the increasing taste for reading, it is now very
possible for man or woman to earn a decent and
honourable livelihood by the pen; but if possible,
it is not easy, and is always, with the best
of talents, eminently precarious.  For a woman
still more so than for a man.  Above all, the
woman must have good friends, must be
"respectable," and fortunate.
</p>

<p>
Hester had no good friends; she had many
acquaintances, but no one who interested himself
in her success, no one, at any rate, who both
could and would assist her.  Moreover, she
was not "respectable;" and what was the
consequence? dissolute editors were afraid of her
contributions "on the score of morals."
</p>

<p>
To be brief, Hester struggled in vain to get
employment; and in great danger of starving,
she determined to go back to Walton.  Her
father consented to receive his unhappy child,
and promised that "bye-gones should be bye-gones."
</p>

<p>
She had better have taken a situation as
servant of all-work in a lodginghouse, than have
returned to her home after what had occurred.
She found her father, indeed, glad enough to
receive her, and willing enough to forgive the
past, on condition of not absolutely <i>forgetting</i>
it: from time to time he could not refrain from
"throwing it in her teeth," when he was at a
loss for an argument or an invective.
</p>

<p>
This is always the case when a fallen daughter
returns home, or when she commits the one
unpardonable fault, and stays at home: her
parents, her brothers, and sisters&mdash;oh! especially
the sisters&mdash;never forget that fault.  It is
held over her head <i>in terrorem</i>.  It is an
ever-present warning and illustration.  Bridling up
in <i>their</i> unshaken chastity&mdash;too often unshaken
because untempted&mdash;the sisters make her feel
in a hundred ways, that her fault is unpardoned
and unpardonable.  Exasperated by this incessant
and unjust retribution for a fault which
the girl feels deserves more pity, she is at last
driven from home and takes refuge in the streets,
because her virtuous family cannot forget!
</p>

<p>
It has been often remarked that women are
more pitiless towards each other, on that very
point where common sympathy should make
them most tolerant; and little do they know
the extent of the mischief their intolerance
creates.
</p>

<p>
Hester had not to suffer from the sneers and
allusions of chaste and offended sisters, but she
had to endure worse&mdash;the sneers and slights
of the whole offended town.  The reader
remembers how Walton was scandalized at her
flirtation, how shocked at her flight; let him
then imagine the howl of outraged purity
which saluted her repentant return!  She,
indeed, come back to a town she had disgraced!
She to show herself amongst the daughters of
respectable people!  She to be allowed to wallow
in corruption, and then as soon as she found
that course led to no good, to return again to
her home as if nothing had occurred!  The
minx!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ruddles hoped her husband would take
notice of it from the pulpit: such an example
as it was to other girls!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Spedley expected to see many imitations
of such conduct; it was such a premium on
vice!
</p>

<p>
The post-mistress hoped she was as charitable
as most people, but she knew what was due to
herself, and as long as that creature remained in
Walton, she, the post-mistress, could not think
of purchasing anything at her father's shop.
</p>

<p>
Nor, for that matter, could Mrs. Spedley.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ruddles had never for an instant
thought of such a thing.  It would be a positive
encouragement.  Mrs. Ruddles herself had
daughters.  She knew something, she thought,
of what constituted a well-regulated mind.
She had no fears for her Arabella, Mary, and
Martha Jane; but Mrs. Ruddles knew the ill
effects of example.
</p>

<p>
When Hester appeared in the street, all the
women instantly crossed to the other side.  If
she went into a shop to make a purchase,
the shop immediately became empty.  Women
avoided her as if she were a walking pestilence.
</p>

<p>
<i>En revanche</i> the men ogled her with effrontery,
and even middle-aged rotundities with
large families, gave themselves killing airs when
in her presence.
</p>

<p>
The stupid ignorance of men!  I declare the
older I grow the more amazed I am at the dull,
purblind, inexcusable ignorance in which one-half
of the human race seems destined to remain
with respect to the other half, in spite of all
experience.  To meet with a man who has not
some gross prejudice, founded on the most
blundering misconception with regard to the
nature of women, and on that point, too, which
one would imagine they would best understand,
is really one of the rarest occurrences.  The
vast majority of men never seem to escape
from the ideas they form about women at
school; and no contradiction in the shape of
experience seems to suggest to them that those
ideas are essentially false.  To hear men&mdash;and
men of the world too&mdash;talk about women, is to
hear the strangest absurdities and platitudes
you can listen to on any subject; to be let into
the secret of their conduct towards women, is
only to see the ludicrous results to which such
erroneous opinions lead them.
</p>

<p>
It is a tempting subject, but I am not going
to pursue this diatribe.  I have an illustration
to give instead.
</p>

<p>
Hester Mason having committed a <i>faux
pas</i>, was instantly, and from that very cause,
looked upon by all the men, young and old, as
a woman "to be had for the asking."  In their
simplicity, they could admit of no gradations
between a Lucretia and Messalina.  If a woman
were not as chaste as ice, she must necessarily
be utterly abandoned.  If one man had succeeded
in overcoming her scruples, of course
another might.  The dolts!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it is owing to our prudery, which
keeps so strict a surveillance over every word
and act, that the smallest licence seems to
imply the extremity of licentiousness!
</p>

<p>
The school-boy notion of the facility of
women was at the bottom of their minds, and
with beautiful simplicity some of the "knowing
dogs" commenced the attack upon Hester's
virtue, without even thinking it necessary to
adopt a semblance of respect and attachment.
</p>

<p>
Certainly Hester was not a woman, under
any circumstances, to have admitted the
addresses of these men; but now, the undisguised
insolence and fatuity of their approaches not
only made her cheek burn with shame, but
made her heart sick with disgust.
</p>

<p>
With scorn and withering sarcasms she
discomfited them one after the other.  The
contemptible fools instantly joined the chorus of
the women; and with good proof that at any
rate, she was not altogether abandoned, they
were unanimous in their execration of her infamy.
</p>

<p>
If women were not purer, stronger, and
honester than the dull and coarse imaginations
of most men depict them, what a world this
would be! what children would these women
bring forth!
</p>

<p>
Those men who have known women, known
how great their influence for good and for evil,
known what a well of feeling, of pure, spontaneous
nature, untarnished by contact with the
world, there lies hidden in a woman's breast;
those who have known how this nature has
moulded their own minds, refined its coarseness,
giving beauty to its strength, will exclaim with
me: what a world would this be were women
what men generally suppose them!
</p>

<p>
Here is Hester Mason, certainly not a good
specimen of her sex: vain, capricious, wilful,
sensual, perverted by sounding sophisms
respecting the rights of women, and the injustice
of the marriage laws; she acts up to her
opinions, and throws herself away upon a rich
and titled noodle for the sake of furthering her
ambitious projects; she finds out her mistake,
returns home repentant, and instantly a number
of ill-conditioned, coarse-minded, coarse-mannered
men imagine she cannot hesitate to
stoop to them!  Believing that she acted from
unrestrained licentiousness, they interpreted one
act, in this school-boy fashion, and hoped to
profit by her weakness.  But they found out
their mistake; or rather never found it out, for
they attributed her refusal to viler motives than
those to which they would have attributed her
consent.
</p>

<p>
The insult of their proposals struck deep into
her heart&mdash;deeper far than the scorn of her own
sex; and it made her so wretched, that, at last,
it drove her once more from her home.  Yes,
home became insupportable, and in a moment
of desperation she fled; fled to London, and
there endeavoured to seek oblivion in the
turbulent vortex of a career which one shudders to
contemplate.
</p>

<p>
Of all the tortures, of all the humiliations to
which she had submitted, none equalled that of
meeting Cecil.  In her strange unhappy life
there had been but one short dream, and that
was her love for Cecil; even when he had
rejected her love, and humiliated her by his
rejection, she still felt towards him something
of that elevating, purifying attachment which
forms a sort of serene heaven smiling upon the
most abject condition&mdash;which is, as it were, the
ideal region where the purest, brightest thoughts
take refuge.  And to meet him in the streets&mdash;to
appear before his eyes in the flaunting finery
of disgrace&mdash;to let him see the abyss into which
she had fallen!  Poor girl! if her errors had no
other expiation than that, bitterly would she
have expiated them.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
THE WIFE AWAITING HER HUSBAND.
</h3>

<p>
While the wretched girl wandered distractedly
on her way, goaded by the pangs of shame and
remorse, the still more wretched Cecil, calm in
his concentrated despair, was walking along the
river side, pursued by the Eumenides, eager to
reach a quiet spot where he might end his
blighted existence.
</p>

<p>
The snow fell in large flakes that cold
January night; and as each flake sank gently
on the quiet bosom of the river, and silently
disappeared in it, leaving no other trace than
the smallest possible circle, it seemed to him
an image of his own disappearance from this
stormy, sunless world.  In the deep, quiet
bosom of Eternity was he about to vanish:
from this scene of turmoil and disgrace, he
was to drop into the swiftly flowing river
of Eternity, in it to be absorbed like to those
flakes of snow.  There was comfort in that
thought.
</p>

<p>
He walked on, thinking of what his wife
and child would do when left by him.  He
thought sadly of Blanche's misery; for he
knew the depth of her affection for him&mdash;for
him who had so ill repaid it, who had
brought such shame and sorrow on her head;
but he endeavoured to console himself with
the reflection that her father would take care
of her, and that, perhaps, the best thing that
could occur to her was to become a widow.
</p>

<p>
In those lucid moments which precede the
last solemn act, he reviewed his conduct with
melancholy clearness; and, undimmed by
sophisms, his conduct appeared to him in its
true light.
</p>

<p>
He grew calmer as he walked.  He thought
of his child with something like satisfaction,
when he reflected that she was too young to
know anything of her father's disgrace; and
that, before she grew old enough even to
prattle about him, all would be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Then he thought of Hester, in her miserable
finery, and followed her in imagination through
the rapid stages of her inevitable career.
</p>

<p>
And he thought of Frank, then so prosperous,
but soon, as he foresaw, to be dragged down
from his prosperity to the destitution which
must quickly follow; and he saw him dying in
an hospital.
</p>

<p>
And the thought of death was sweeter to
him, as he walked musingly on.
</p>

<p>
A light was dimly shining in Blanche's bedroom,
and she was seated by the window looking
out into the night, awaiting the return of
him who was to return no more.  Her child
was sleeping calmly; no hint of the anguish
which ploughed the hearts of its parents
troubled its quiet breathing.
</p>

<p>
The clock struck twelve.
</p>

<p>
A heavy sigh issued from the watcher as the
strokes fell upon her ear, and she rose to snuff
the enormous wick of the neglected candle.
She then resumed her seat at the window.
</p>

<p>
"When will he come?" she asked herself, sadly.
</p>

<p>
She feared to meet him&mdash;feared to look upon
his face, after what had passed; feared lest he,
upon whose brow she had been wont to see the
imperial stamp of genius&mdash;in whose eye the
lustre of a glorious mind, on whose lips the
smile of unutterable tenderness,&mdash;there should
now be legible the stamp of infamy, the dull
look of shame, the cynical sneer of recklessness.
</p>

<p>
She feared to meet him, yet she could not
repress her impatience to see him: a vague
dread that he might not return, shifted to and
fro before her mind, and kept her anxiously
watching.
</p>

<p>
The clock struck one.
</p>

<p>
Her candle was guttering in the socket, and
she lighted another.  She bent over the cradle
of her sleeping infant with a searching look of
love; and seeing that it slept peacefully, she
again resumed her seat at the window.
</p>

<p>
The snow had ceased to fall.  The bright
stars were lustrous in the deep, dark, moonless
heavens, in which they seemed suspended.
The ground was white with the untrodden
snow, as also were the tops of the houses, and
the branches of the trees.  Not a breath of
wind stirred.  All was silent without, hushed
in the repose of night.  Not a footstep was
heard; not even the distant barking of some
watchful dog.
</p>

<p>
Cold, cheerless, desolate as a leafless tree,
was the night out into which the watcher
looked, awaiting her husband's return; but he
came not, would not come!
</p>

<p>
The clock struck two.
</p>

<p>
The watcher stirred the fire, and drew the
shawl closer around her.  She was cold; but
it was not the cold of that winter night which
numbed her limbs, it was the cold icy fear
which momently assumed a more definite and
consistent shape.
</p>

<p>
She no longer asked: "when will he come?"
</p>

<p>
Her teeth chattered as the thought that he
would never come, grew more and more like a
certainty.
</p>

<p>
There was a shroud upon the earth: a pure,
white, stainless shroud, prepared for one who
was yet young, but who had lived too long.
</p>

<p>
To her widowed eyes this garment of snow,
which nature wore, became a terrible symbol,
and the stars seemed to look down upon her in
infinite compassion.
</p>

<p>
He came not; could not come.  The silent
river had opened to receive him, and was now
flowing swiftly and silently over his lifeless
corpse.
</p>

<p>
The clock struck three.
</p>

<p>
A cry of agony broke from the watcher as
those three small strokes with horrible distinctness
fell upon her ear and seemed to utter,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He is dead!"
</p>

<p>
But she remained at her window looking; out
into the night.  For two hours longer did she
sit there, and then dropped into a feverish sleep,
visited by happy, though broken, dreams.
</p>

<p>
She dreamed that she had dreamed her
husband had committed a forgery, and that
she awoke to find it but a dream: how great
her joy, as she clasped him by the hand and
told him all! and how his tender eyes bent
down upon her as he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What! think that of <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p>
And she awoke&mdash;awoke to find herself seated
at the window&mdash;the dull winter morning struggling
into obscure day&mdash;the snow heaped up on
the window ledge, and covering everything
without&mdash;and the crushing reality was once more
threatening her!

THE GAMBLER'S END.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Her candle was burnt out; the fire had only a
few live embers which went out directly she
attempted to revive it.  She was numbed with
cold; weary with grief; and threw herself upon
the bed.
</p>

<p>
Sleep was impossible.  A settled, though
vague, conviction that Cecil would not return
had taken possession of her mind.  She fancied
that he must have lost the money, and was now
lying concealed for fear of the consequences of
his crime.
</p>

<p>
As the morning fairly broke, she put on her
things, and hurried to Captain Heath to ask
his assistance and advice.  He was at breakfast
when she arrived, and her appearance so wan,
and yet so strangely supernaturally calm, made
him fear the worst.
</p>

<p>
"Cecil has not returned," she said quietly.
"What is to be done?"
</p>

<p>
The captain at once guessed the truth, and
was silent.
</p>

<p>
"He is ashamed to return," she said.  "How
are we to learn where he is?"
</p>

<p>
He remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"If we were to advertise in the papers," she
suggested, "could we not by that means let
him know that his ... imprudence ... has been
overlooked?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes.  That is the only plan."
</p>

<p>
"Will you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"At once; but go you home, he may return
every minute."
</p>

<p>
"You think, then, he will return?" she asked
with more emotion in her voice than she had
hitherto betrayed.
</p>

<p>
He trembled slightly as he answered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"At any rate ... you had better be there."
</p>

<p>
She pressed his hand mournfully, and
withdrew, leaving Heath amazed and alarmed at
the quietude of her manner.
</p>

<p>
On reaching Hammersmith she saw at some
distance before her, a large crowd of people
hurrying along.  She quietly wondered what it
could be; perhaps a fire; perhaps a man led
to the station house; perhaps a show which
the crowd followed wondering.
</p>

<p>
She walked on, till she saw the crowd stop at
her own house, and then she flew, urged on by
some quick sudden fear&mdash;she pierced the
crowd&mdash;she entered the house&mdash;in the passage were
four men bearing a corpse on a shutter: her
heart told her whose corpse it was before her
eyes had recognised it.
</p>

<p>
She saw no more.
</p>

<p>
When next she became conscious, she found
herself in her old bedroom at her father's, her
sister Violet seated by her bedside, gazing
inquiringly upon her.  The fever was subsiding,
and her life was saved.

CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
EXPLANATION.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"Mrs. Dombey, it is very necessary that there should be
some understanding arrived at between us.  Your conduct does
not please me, madam .... I have made you my wife.  You
bear my name.  You are associated with my position and my
reputation."
</p>

<p class="intro">
CHARLES DICKENS.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On the day on which Cecil had forged the
cheque, Meredith Vyner entered his wife's
boudoir with the intention of coming to a
serious explanation with her.
</p>

<p>
Several times, lately, had the word "separation"
been pronounced between them, without,
however, her attaching much importance to it.
She knew that he was miserable, she knew that
his love for her had been worn away, but she
knew also that he was weak, and thought he
would never have courage enough to proceed to
extremities.
</p>

<p>
In this she made a great mistake.  Vyner
was weak, it is true, but he was also obstinate;
he was easily cajoled, but not easily driven
from any plan he had once resolved on.  Unable
to resist the wildest caprices of his wife,
while he loved her, she lost all power over him
in losing his affection.  This she did not suspect.
Like many other people, she altogether miscalculated
the nature of her power over him, and
imagined that what she really gained by
cajolery and pretended affection, she gained by
mere cunning and strength of will.
</p>

<p>
Their relative positions were altogether
changed.  Vyner, no longer the doating
husband, was now the obstinate man.  He saw
that it was impossible to live happily with her,
and saw that if his children were once more
around him&mdash;if Violet especially were once more
at home&mdash;he could again resume his peaceful
routine of existence.
</p>

<p>
"I am come to speak seriously to you," he
said, as seating himself opposite to her, he drew
out his deliberative snuff-box.
</p>

<p>
"And I am in no humour for it," she replied,
"my head aches.  My nerves are irritable this
morning."
</p>

<p>
"What I have to say must be said, and the
sooner it is said the better for both of us."
</p>

<p>
She was surprised at the firmness of his manner.
</p>

<p>
"It is on the old subject," he added; "I need
not again recapitulate the many strong objections
your conduct this last year has given rise
to, but I wish once for all to understand whether
you intend persisting in it, or whether you
will pay a little more attention to what is due
both to me and yourself."
</p>

<p>
"How tiresome you are on that subject!
When will you understand that a young woman
cannot have an old head upon her shoulders,
unless it is also an ugly one?  I shall be grave
and sedate enough in time, I dare say; meanwhile,
allow me to observe, that, although I may
be fond of admiration, yet I know perfectly well
what is due to myself."
</p>

<p>
"If you know it, you do not demean yourself
in consequence."
</p>

<p>
"That is the question.  I maintain that I
do; and I suppose I am old enough to know
what is right on such matters."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Can you name any one instance in which
I have overstepped the limits to which even
English rigidity confines a young woman?"
</p>

<p>
"Your encouragement of the attentions of
Mr. Ashley...."
</p>

<p>
"Again, Mr. Ashley!"
</p>

<p>
"Of Mr. Maxwell...."
</p>

<p>
She burst out laughing; but the laugh was
hollow.
</p>

<p>
"Of Lord * * * * who every day...."
</p>

<p>
"Why he's as old as you are!"
</p>

<p>
Vyner winced at the epigram, which indeed
was cruel and insulting.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity you did not think of the great
disparity in our ages before you married me,
Mrs. Vyner."
</p>

<p>
"A great pity."
</p>

<p>
"I have often thought so of late."
</p>

<p>
"How much better had you thought so before
you made me an offer!"
</p>

<p>
"It was the greatest mistake I ever made,
but&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Sic visum Veneri, cui placeat impares<br>
  Formas atque animos sub juga aënea<br>
  Sævo mittere cum joco!'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Vyner had often made that quotation to himself,
and now launched it with great satisfaction,
as was evident by the noisy pinch of snuff
with which he closed it.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You have spoken," he said, "of
incompatibilities, and I fear they exist.  But,
Mrs. Vyner, if you have destroyed my domestic
happiness, you shall not destroy my future
comfort.  I will not be made a laughing-stock
abroad, and be made miserable at home.  I say
I will <i>not</i>.  I am come, therefore, to offer you
an alternative."
</p>

<p>
"Let me hear it."
</p>

<p>
"You must cease to see Mr. Maxwell and
Lord * * * *"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"I say you <i>must</i>.  Moreover, you must
change your manner entirely, both to other men
and to your husband."
</p>

<p>
"What manner am I to adopt?"
</p>

<p>
"That which befits a well-conducted wife."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Vyner, you are insulting."
</p>

<p>
"In demanding you to do your duty?"
</p>

<p>
"No; in asserting that I do anything derogatory."
</p>

<p>
"You have strange ideas, Mrs. Vyner, on
that point."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so; but they are mine."
</p>

<p>
"They are not mine, however."
</p>

<p>
"That is unfortunate!"
</p>

<p>
"Very.  I am demanding nothing extraordinary,
I imagine, in insisting that you should
cease to flirt with others, and should pay more
respect and deference to my wishes than you
have done of late.  I do not demand affection..."
</p>

<p>
She again shrugged her shoulders; he perceived it.
</p>

<p>
"Because," he continued, "I know that is
absurd; whatever regard you may once have had
for me is gone.  I do not even demand
gratitude for the kindness I have ever shown
you&mdash;and you must admit that I have been an
indulgent husband&mdash;foolishly so.  But I have a
right to demand from a wife a fulfilment at
least of the most ordinary duties of a wife, and
a certain amount of respect, or the show of it at
any rate.  This I have a right to demand, and
this I will have."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner was not a woman to brook such
a dictatorial tone even from the man she loved;
and we have seen how Maxwell, when he
adopted it, only irritated her to an unusual
degree; from Vyner, whom she had been
accustomed to sway as she pleased; from Vyner
whom she disliked, and somewhat despised, this
tone was, therefore, excessively offensive.
</p>

<p>
Her lip quivered as she replied, "This is a
subject upon which we can never agree.  I hold
myself to be quite competent to judge of my
own actions, and until I have done anything to
forfeit the good opinion of the world, I shall
continue to act as I think proper."
</p>

<p>
"That is your final determination?"
</p>

<p>
"It is.  I hope it will be unnecessary for me
to repeat it."
</p>

<p>
"In coming here I expected this, so I came
prepared."
</p>

<p>
"Let me hear your alternative."
</p>

<p>
"A separation."
</p>

<p>
She started; not at the word&mdash;that she had
heard before&mdash;but at the quiet, dogged resolution
of the tone.  A flush of angry pride ran over
her cheeks and brow.
</p>

<p>
"It is very terrible, your alternative!" she
said, ironically.
</p>

<p>
"Are you prepared to accept it?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then, in that case, I have
only to see about the settlements, and in a
week or two, at the farthest, the affair can be
arranged."
</p>

<p>
He put back his snuff-box into his huge
pocket, as he said this, and walked out of the
room with a calmness that lent dignity to his
lumpish figure.
</p>

<p>
She drooped her head upon her hand, and
reflected.  Revolted pride, anger, and fear were
struggling in her breast.  Irritated as she was
by her husband's manner, she could not reflect
upon the separation without uneasiness.
</p>

<p>
As his wife, she had an enviable position;
separated from him, she not only lost the
advantages of that position, in a deprivation of
wealth, but also in a deprivation of the
consideration with which the world regarded her.
A woman separated from her husband is always
equivocally placed; even when the husband is
notorious as a bad character, as a man of
unendurable temper, or bitten with some
disgraceful vice, society always looks obliquely at
the woman separated from him; and when she
has no such glaring excuse, her position is
more than equivocal.  "Respectable" women
will not receive her; or do so with a certain
nuance of reluctance.  Men gossip about her,
and regard her as a fair mark for their
gallantries.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner knew all this thoroughly; she
had refused to know women in that condition;
at Mrs. Langley Turner's, where she had more
than once encountered these black sheep, she
had turned aside her head, and by a thousand
little impertinent airs made them feel the
difference between her purity and their disgrace.  A
separation, therefore, was not a thing to be
lightly thought of; yet the idea of obeying
Vyner, of accepting his conditions, made her
cheek burn with indignation.
</p>

<p>
Absorbed in thought she sat, weighing, as in
a delicate balance, the conflicting considerations
which arose within her, and ever and anon
asking herself,&mdash;"What has become of Maxwell?"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0814"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
THE ALTERNATIVE.
</h3>

<p>
Maxwell had just recovered from the effect of
that broken bloodvessel which terminated the
paroxysm of passion Mrs. Vyner's language and
conduct had thrown him into.
</p>

<p>
At the very moment when she was asking
herself, "What has become of Maxwell?" he
concluded his will, arranged all his papers,
burnt many letters, and, going to a drawer,
took from them a pair of pocket pistols with
double barrels.
</p>

<p>
He was very pale, and his veins seemed
injected with bile in lieu of blood; but he was
excessively calm.
</p>

<p>
In one so violent, in one whose anger was
something more like madness than any normal
condition of the human mind, who from
childhood upwards had been unrestrained in the
indulgence of his passion, this calmness was
appalling.
</p>

<p>
He loaded the four barrels with extreme precision,
having previously cleared the touchholes,
and not only affixed the caps with care, but
also took the precaution of putting some
extra caps in his waistcoat pocket in case of
accidents.
</p>

<p>
His hand did not tremble once; on his brow
there was no scowl; on his colourless lips no
grim smile; but calm, as if he were about the
most indifferent act of his life, and breathing
regularly as if no unusual thought was in his
mind, he finished the priming of those deadly
instruments, and placed them in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
Once more did he read over his will; and then
having set everything in order, rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Fetch a cab," he said quietly to the servant
who entered.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going out, sir?" asked the astonished
servant.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see I am?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir,&mdash;only you are but just out of
bed...."
</p>

<p>
"I am quite well enough."
</p>

<p>
There was no reply possible.  The cab was
brought.  He stepped into it, and drove to
Mrs. Vyner's.
</p>

<p>
Although she was thinking of him at the
very moment when he was announced, she
started at the sound of his name.  His
appearance startled her still more.  She saw that
he could only just have risen from a bed of
sickness, and that sickness she knew had been
caused by the vehemence of his love for her.
</p>

<p>
Affectionate as was her greeting, it brought
no smile upon his lips, no light into his glazed
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The hypocrite!" was his mental exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! Maxwell, how I have longed to see
you," she said  "you left me in anger, and
I confess I did not behave well to you; but
why have you not been here before? did you
not know that I was but too anxious to make it
up with you?"
</p>

<p>
"How should I know that?" he quietly asked.
</p>

<p>
"How! did you not know my love for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not," he said, perfectly unmoved.
</p>

<p>
"You did not?  Oh you ungrateful creature!
Is that the return I am to meet with?
Is it to say such things that you are here?"
</p>

<p>
A slight smile played in his eyes for a
moment, but his lips were motionless.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said, "you have been angry
with me&mdash;I have been wrong&mdash;let us forget
and forgive."
</p>

<p>
He did not touch her proffered hand, but
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If for once in your life you can be frank, be
so now."
</p>

<p>
"I will.  What am I to say?"
</p>

<p>
Carelessly putting both hands into his coat
pockets, and grasping the pistols, he rose,
stretched out his coat tails, and stood before
her in an attitude usual with him, and
characteristic of Englishmen generally, when
standing with their backs to the fire.
</p>

<p>
"You promise to be frank?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
"Then tell me whether Lord * * * * * was
here yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"He was."
</p>

<p>
"Will he be here to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Most likely."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have not given him his congé?"
</p>

<p>
"Not I."
</p>

<p>
Maxwell paused and looked at her keenly,
his right hand grasping firmly the pistol in his
pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Then may I ask the reason of your very
civil reception of me to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"The reason!  Civil!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the reason, the motive: you must have one."
</p>

<p>
"Is not my love...."
</p>

<p>
"You promised to be frank," he said,
menacingly.
</p>

<p>
"I did&mdash;I am so."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us have no subterfuge of language&mdash;speak
plainly&mdash;it will be better for you."
</p>

<p>
"Maxwell, if you are come here to irritate
me with your jealousy, and your absurd doubts,
you have chosen a bad time.  I am not well.
I am not happy.  I do not wish to quarrel with
you&mdash;do not force me to it."
</p>

<p>
"Beware!" he said, in deep solemn tones.
</p>

<p>
"Beware you!  George, do not provoke me&mdash;pray
do not.  Sit down and talk reasonably.
What is it you want to ask me?"
</p>

<p>
"I repeat: the motive for your civility to me?"
</p>

<p>
"And I repeat: my love."
</p>

<p>
"Your love!"
</p>

<p>
"There again!  Why will you torment me
with this absurd doubt?  Why should you
doubt me?  Have I any interest in deceiving
you?  You are not my husband.&mdash;It is very
strange that when I do not scruple to avow my
love, you should scruple to believe me."
</p>

<p>
"My scruples arise from my knowledge of
you: you are a coquette."
</p>

<p>
"I know it; but not to you."
</p>

<p>
"Solemnly&mdash;do you love me?"
</p>

<p>
"Solemnly&mdash;I do!"
</p>

<p>
He paused again, as unprepared for this
dissimulation.  She withstood his gaze without
flinching.
</p>

<p>
An idea suddenly occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, after what I have seen, doubts are
justifiable.  Are you prepared to give me a
proof?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, any; name it."
</p>

<p>
"Will you go with me to France?"
</p>

<p>
"Run away with you?"
</p>

<p>
"You refuse!" he said, half drawing a pistol
from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
She was bewildered.  The suddenness of the
proposition, and its tremendous importance
staggered her.
</p>

<p>
A deep gloom concentrated on his face; the
crisis had arrived, and he only awaited a word
from her to blow her brains out.
</p>

<p>
With the indescribable rapidity of thought,
her mind embraced the whole consequences of
his offer&mdash;weighed the chances&mdash;exposed the
peril of her situation with her husband, and
permitted her to calculate whether, since
separation seemed inevitable, there would not be
an advantage in accepting Maxwell's offer.
"He loves me," she said; "loves me as no
one ever loved before.  With him I shall be
happy."
</p>

<p>
"I await your decision," he said.
</p>

<p>
"George, I am yours!"
</p>

<p>
She flung herself upon his neck.  He was
so astonished at her resolution, that at first he
could not believe it, and his hands still
grasped the pistols; but by degrees her embrace
convinced him, and clasping her in his arms,
he exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Your love has saved you!  You shall be
a happy woman&mdash;I will be your slave!"

CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
THOSE LEFT TO WEEP.
</h3>

<p>
The discovery of Mrs. Vyner's flight was
nearly coincident with the announcement of
Cecil's suicide.  Poor Vyner was like a
madman.  He reproached himself for having spoken
so harshly to his wife, for having driven her
to this desperate act, and thus causing her
ruin.  Had he been more patient, more
tolerant!  She was so young, so giddy, so
impulsive, he ought to have had more
consideration for her!
</p>

<p>
It was quite clear to Vyner's mind that he
had behaved very brutally, and that his wife
was an injured innocent.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of this grief, there came the
horrible intelligence of Cecil's end.  There
again Vyner reproached himself.  Why did
he allow Blanche to marry that unhappy
young man?  On second thoughts, "he had
never allowed it"; but yet it was he who
encouraged Cecil&mdash;who invited him to his
seat&mdash;who pressed him to stay!
</p>

<p>
In vain did Captain Heath remonstrate with
him on this point; Vyner was at that moment
in a remorseful, self-reproachful spirit, which
no arguments could alter.  He left everything
to Captain Heath's management, with the
helplessness of weak men, and sat desolate
in his study, wringing his hands, taking ounces
of snuff, and overwhelming himself with
unnecessary reproaches.
</p>

<p>
Blanche, in a brain fever, was removed to
her father's, where she was watched by the
miserable old man, as if he had been the cause
of her sorrow.  Violet was sent for from her
uncle's, and established herself once more in
the house.  Now her step-mother was gone, she
could devote herself to her father.
</p>

<p>
Blanche's return to consciousness was
unhappily also a return to that fierce sorrow
which nothing but time could assuage.  She
was only induced to live by the reflection that
her child needed her care.  But what a prospect
was it for her!  How could she ever smile
again!  How could she ever cease to weep for
her kind, affectionate, erring, but beloved Cecil!
</p>

<p>
It is the intensity of all passion which makes
us think it must be eternal; and it is this very
intensity which makes it so short-lived.  In a
few months Blanche occasionally smiled; her
grief began to take less the shape of a thing
present, and more that of a thing past; it was
less of a sensation, and more of a reverie.
</p>

<p>
At first the image of her husband was a
ghastly image of dishonour and early wreck;
his face wore the stern keen look of suspicion
which had agitated her when last she saw him
alive; or else it wore the placidity of the corpse
which she had last beheld.  Behind that ghastly
image stood the background of their happy
early days of marriage, so shortlived, yet so
exquisite!
</p>

<p>
In time the ghastliness faded away, and
round the image of her husband, there was
a sort of halo&mdash;the background gradually
invaded the foreground, till at last the picture
had no more melancholy in it than there is in
some sweet sunset over a quiet sea.  The tears
she shed were no longer bitter: they were the
sweet and pensive tears shed by that melancholy
which finds pleasure in its own indulgence.
</p>

<p>
Grief had lost its pang.  Her mind, familiarized
with her loss, no longer dwelt upon
the painful, but on the beautiful side of the
past.  Her child was there to keep alive the
affectionate remembrance of its father, without
suggesting the idea of the moody, irritable,
ungenerous husband, which Cecil had at the
last become.
</p>

<p>
Like a child crying itself to sleep&mdash;passing
from sorrow into quiet breathing&mdash;her grief had
passed into pensiveness.  Cecil's image was as
a star smiling down upon her from heaven:
round it were clustered quiet, happy thoughts,
not the less happy because shadowed with a
seriousness which <i>had been</i> grief.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
THE VOICE OF PASSION.
</h3>

<p>
Vyner soon recovered from the double shock
he had sustained, and was now quite happy
again with his two girls, and his excellent
friend Heath, as his constant companions;
while Julius and Rose were seldom two days
absent from them.
</p>

<p>
For the sake of Blanche they now returned
to Wytton Hall, and there her health was slowly
but steadily restored.
</p>

<p>
Captain Heath was her companion in almost
every walk and drive; reading to her the books
she wished; daily becoming a greater favourite
with little Rose Blanche, who would leave even
her nurse to come to him; and daily feeling
serener, as his love grew not deeper, but less
unquiet: less, as he imagined, like a lover's love,
and more like that of an elder brother.
</p>

<p>
Blanche was happier with him than with any
one else; not that she loved him, not even that
she divined his love; since Cecil's death, his
manner had been even less demonstrative than
it had ever been before, and it would have been
impossible for the keenest observer to have
imagined there was anything like love in his
attentions.
</p>

<p>
What quiet blissful months those were which
they then passed: Vyner once more absorbed
in his Horace; Blanche daily growing stronger,
and less melancholy; Heath living as one in a
dream; Violet hearing, with a woman's pride
in him she loves, of Marmaduke's immense
success in parliament, where he was already
looked up to as the future Chatham or Burke.
</p>

<p>
Every time Violet saw Marmaduke's name in
the papers, her heart fluttered against the bars
of its prison, and she groaned at the idea of
being separated from him.  Indeed her letters
to Rose were so full of Marmaduke, that Rose
planned with Julius a little scheme to bring the
two unexpectedly together, as soon as Violet
returned to town.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure Violet loves him," said Rose;
"I don't at all understand what has occurred
to separate them.  Violet is silent on the point,
and is uneasy if I allude to it.  But don't
you agree with me, Julius, that she must love
him?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it very probable."
</p>

<p>
"Probable!  Why not certain?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, you know, I am apt to be
suspicious on that subject."
</p>

<p>
"I know you are," she said, laughing and
shaking her locks at him, "and a pretty judge
you are of a woman's heart!"
</p>

<p>
Julius allowed himself to be persuaded that
Violet really did love Marmaduke, and
accordingly some weeks afterwards, when the Vyners
had returned, Julius arranged a pic-nic in which
Marmaduke was to join, without Violet's
knowledge.  Fearful lest she should refuse to
accompany them if she saw him before starting, it was
agreed that Marmaduke should meet them at
Richmond.
</p>

<p>
Imagine with what feverish impatience he
awaited them, and with what a sinking,
anxious heart he appeared amongst them.
Violet blushed, and looked at Rose; the
laughter in her eyes plainly betrayed her share
in the plot, in defiance of the affected gravity
of her face.  He shook hands with such of the
company as he knew personally, was introduced
to the others, and then quietly seated
himself beside Violet, in a manner so free from
either embarrassment or gallantry, that it put
her quite at her ease.  She had determined,
from the first, to frustrate Rose's
kindly-intentioned scheme; and she felt that she had
strength enough to do so.  But his manner
at once convinced her that, however he might
have been brought there, it was with no intention
of taking any advantage of their meeting
to open forbidden subjects.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke was in high spirits, and talked
quite brilliantly.  Violet was silent; but from
time to time, as he turned to address a remark
to her, he saw her look of admiration, and that
inspired him.
</p>

<p>
I need not describe the pic-nic, for time
presses, and pic-nics are all very much alike.
Enough if we know that the day was spent
merrily and noisily, and that dinner was noisier
and merrier than all: the champagne drank,
amounting to something incredible.
</p>

<p>
Evening was drawing in.  The last rays of
a magnificent sunset were fading in the western
sky, and the cool breeze springing up warned
the company that it was time to prepare for
their return.
</p>

<p>
The boisterous gaiety of the afternoon and
dinner had ceased.  Every one knows the effect
of an exhilarating feast, followed by a listless
exhausted hour or two; when the excitement
produced by wine and laughter has passed
away, a lassitude succeeds, which in poetical
minds induces a tender melancholy, in prosaic
minds a desire for stimulus or sleep.
</p>

<p>
As the day went down, all the guests were
exhausted, except Marmaduke and Violet, who,
while the others were gradually becoming
duller and duller, had insensibly wandered
away, engrossed in the most enchanting
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Did I not tell you?" whispered Rose, as
she pointed out to Julius the retreating figures
of her sister and Marmaduke.
</p>

<p>
Away the lovers wandered, and although
their hearts were full of love, although their
eyes were speaking it as eloquently as love
can speak, not a syllable crossed their lips
which could be referred to it.  A vague
yearning&mdash;a dim, melancholy, o'ermastering feeling
held its empire over their souls.  The witching
twilight, closing in so strange a day, seemed
irresistibly to guide their thoughts into that one
channel which they had hitherto so dexterously
avoided.  Her hand was on his arm&mdash;he pressed
it tenderly, yet gently&mdash;so gently!&mdash;to his side.
He gazed into her large lustrous eyes, and
intoxicated by their beauty and tenderness, he
began to speak.
</p>

<p>
"It is getting late.  We must return.  We
must separate.  Oh!  Violet, before we separate,
tell me that it is not for ever&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Marmaduke!" she stammered out, alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest, dearest Violet, we shall meet
again&mdash;you will let me see you&mdash;will you not?"
</p>

<p>
She was silent, struggling.
</p>

<p>
They walked on a few paces; then he again
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You will not banish me entirely&mdash;you will
from time to time&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, Marmaduke," she said, solemnly; "no,
it will not be right.  You need not look so
pained&mdash;I&mdash;have I nothing to overcome when
I forego the delight of seeing you?  But it
must not be.  You know that it cannot be."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of the kind!" he impetuously
exclaimed; "I only know that you do
not love me!"
</p>

<p>
She looked reproachfully at him; but his
head was turned away.
</p>

<p>
"Cold, cold as marble," he muttered as they
walked on.
</p>

<p>
She did not answer him.  Lovers are always
unreasonable and unjust.  He was furious at
her "coldness;" she was hurt at his misunderstanding
her.  She could have implored him to
be more generous; but he gave her no
encouragement&mdash;he spoke no word&mdash;kept his look
averted.  Thus neither tried to explain away
the other's misconception; neither smoothed
the other's ruffled anger.  In silence they walked
on, environed by their pride.  The longer they
kept silent, the bitterer grew their feelings;&mdash;the
more he internally reprobated her for coldness,
the more she was hurt at his refusal to acknowledge
the justness of her resolution, after all that
had passed between them by letter.
</p>

<p>
In this painful state of feeling, they joined
their companions just as the boats were got
ready.
</p>

<p>
Rose looked inquiringly at Violet; but Violet
averted her head.  Julius was troubled to
perceive the evident anger of Marmaduke.
</p>

<p>
The boats pushed off.  The evening was
exquisite, and Rose murmured to Julius the
words of their favourite Leopardi:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Dolce e chiara è la notte, e senza vento,<br>
  E queta sovra i tetti e in mezzo agli orti<br>
  Posa la luna, e di lontan rivela<br>
  Serena ogni montagna.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Wearied by the excitement of the day, they
were almost all plunged in reveries from which
they made no effort to escape.  The regular
dip of the oars in the water, and the falling drops
shaken from them, had a musical cadence, which
fell deliciously on the ear.  It was a dreamy
scene.  The moon rose, and shed her gentle
light upon them, as they moved along, in almost
unbroken silence, upon the silver stream.  The
last twitter of the birds had ceased; the
regular and soothing sounds of the oars alone kept
them in a sort of half consciousness of being
awake.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke and Violet were suffering tortures.
She occasionally stole a glance at him,
and with redoubled pain read upon his haughty
face the expression of anger and doubt which
so much distressed her.  The large tears rolled
over her face.  She leaned over the boat side to
hide them, and as she saw the river hurrying on
beneath her, she thought of the unhappy Cecil,
and of his untimely end.  Over his dishonoured
corpse had this cold river flowed, as gently as
now it flowed beneath her...  From Cecil her
thoughts wandered to Wytton Hall, and her early
inclination for him&mdash;to her scene in the field
with the bull&mdash;to her first meeting with
Marmaduke; and then she thought no more of
Cecil.
</p>

<p>
Thus they were rowed through the silent
evening.  On reaching town, the party dispersed.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke and Violet separated with cold
politeness, and each went home to spend a
miserable night.
</p>

<p>
For some days did Marmaduke brood over
her refusal, and as he reflected on the strength
of her character, and the slight probability that
she would ever yield&mdash;her very frankness told
him that&mdash;he took a sudden and very loverlike
resolution that he would quit England, and
return to Brazil.
</p>

<p>
Preparations for his departure were not delayed
an instant, and with his usual impetuosity
he had completed every arrangement before
another would have fairly commenced.
</p>

<p>
Leave-taking began.  He wrote to Vyner
announcing his intention, and saying that he
proposed doing himself the pleasure of bidding
them adieu.  He had the faint hope, which
was very faint, that Violet might be present,
and that he might see her for the last time.
Lovers attach a very particular importance to a
last farewell, and angry as Marmaduke was
with Violet, the idea of quitting England for
ever, without once more seeing her, was
extremely painful to him.
</p>

<p>
It was a dull, drizzly day, enough to depress
the most elastic of temperaments.  Violet was
in her father's study, looking out upon the mist
of rain and cloud, debating with herself whether
she should be present during Marmaduke's visit
or not.  After what had passed, she tried to
persuade herself that it was fortunate he was
going to quit England, fearing that her resolution
would never hold out against his renewed
entreaties; but it was in vain she sophisticated
with herself, her heart told her that she was
wretched, intensely wretched at his departure.
</p>

<p>
Her father's voice roused her from this reverie,
and she passed into the drawing-room, where a
few minutes afterwards the servant entered, and
announced "Mr. Ashley."
</p>

<p>
A stream of fire seemed suddenly to pour
along her veins; but by the time he had shaken
hands with Vyner and Blanche, and had turned
to her, she was comparatively calm.  His face
was very sallow, and there was a nervous quivering
of his delicate nostrils, which indicated the
emotion within, but which was unobserved by
her, as her eyes were averted.
</p>

<p>
The conversation was uneasy and common-place.
Marmaduke's manner was calm and
composed, but his voice was low.  Violet sat
with her eyes upon the carpet, deadly pale,
and with colourless lips.  Blanche, who did not
quite understand the relation between them, but
who knew that Violet loved him, was anxious
on her account.  Vyner alone was glib and
easy.  He talked of parliament, and remarked,
that the best thing he knew of it was, that the
members always quoted Horace.
</p>

<p>
As the interview proceeded, Marmaduke's
grave, cold manner became slightly tinged
with irony and bitterness; and when Vyner
said to him, "Apropos, what&mdash;if the question
be permissible&mdash;what induces you to leave
us? are you to be away long?"
</p>

<p>
He replied, with a marked emphasis, "Very long."
</p>

<p>
"Is Brazil, then, so very attractive?"
</p>

<p>
"England ceases to be attractive.  I want
breathing space.  There I can, as Tennyson
sings,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Burst all the links of habit&mdash;there to wander far away,<br>
  On from island unto island, at the gateways of the day.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Blanche, mildly interposing, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But what does he also sing, and in the
same poem?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Violet's eyes were fixed upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
"And, after all&mdash;poetry aside&mdash;what are you
going to do with yourself in that hot climate?"
</p>

<p>
"To marry, perhaps," he said, carelessly,
and with a forced laugh.
</p>

<p>
Violet shook all over; but she did not raise
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"An heiress?" asked Vyner.
</p>

<p>
"No,&mdash;to continue Tennyson,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was singular bitterness, as he added,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In those climates, the passions are not
cramped by the swaddling clothes of civilisation;
their franker natures better suit my own
impulsiveness; when they love they love&mdash;they
do not stultify their hearts with intricate
sophisms."
</p>

<p>
Violet now raised her large eyes, and, with
mournful steadiness, reproached him by a look,
for the words he had just uttered.  He met
her look with one as steady, but flashing with
scorn.
</p>

<p>
"Well, for my part," said Vyner, tapping
his snuff-box, "Brazil would have little attraction
for me, especially if the women are violent.
I can't bear violent women."
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke had expected some remark from
Violet in answer to his speech; but that one
look was her only answer, and she was now as
intently examining the carpet as before.  He
noticed her paleness, and the concentrated
calmness of her manner, and it irritated him
the more.
</p>

<p>
Blanche, with true feminine sagacity, saw
it was desirable, in every case, that Violet
should have an opportunity of speaking with
him alone, so walked out of the room, and in
a few minutes sent the servant with a message
to Vyner that he was wanted for an instant
down stairs.
</p>

<p>
The lovers were now alone, and horribly
embarrassed.  They wanted to break the
uneasy silence, but neither of them could
utter a word.
</p>

<p>
At last Violet, feeling that it was imperative
on her to say something, murmured, without
looking at him,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And when do you start?"
</p>

<p>
"On Monday."
</p>

<p>
Another pause ensued; perhaps worse this
time than before, because of the unsuccessful
attempt.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder whether it still rains?" he said,
after a few moments' silence, and walked to the
window to look out.
</p>

<p>
Left thus sitting by herself&mdash;an emblem of
the far more terrible desertion which was to
follow&mdash;Violet looked in upon her desolate
heart, and felt appalled at the prospect.  The
imperious cry of passion sounded within her,
and would not be gagged: the pent-up tide
burst away the barriers, and rushed precipitately
onwards, carrying before it all scruples like
straws upon a stream.
</p>

<p>
"Marmaduke!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
He turned from the window; she had half-risen
from her seat; he walked up to her.
</p>

<p>
She flung herself into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Is this true, Violet?  Speak&mdash;are you
mine&mdash;mine?"
</p>

<p>
She pressed him closer to her.  It is only
men who find words in such moments; and
Marmaduke was as eloquent as love and
rapture could make him.
</p>

<p>
When she did speak, it was in a low fluttering
tone, her pale face suffused with blushes, as
she told him, that to live apart from him was
<i>impossible</i>;&mdash;either he must stay, or take her
with him.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Vyner had been prettily rated by
Blanche for his dulness in not perceiving that
the lovers wanted to be alone.
</p>

<p>
"But are you certain, Blanche, that they are
lovers?  For my part, I wish it were so; but
although Violet certainly has a regard for him,
I have reason to believe, that he has none for
her."
</p>

<p>
Blanche sighed and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Then let us go back, for in that case, they
will only be uncomfortable together."
</p>

EPILOGUE.

<p class="t3">
1845.

<p class="intro">
"Je l'aurais supprimée si j'écrivais un roman; je sais que

<p class="intro">
MADAME DE STAAL DE LAUNAY.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The moon was serenely shining one soft July
night, exactly ten years from the date of the
prologue to this long drama, when a young
woman crept stealthily from the door of an old
and picturesque-looking house, at the extremity
of the town of Angoulême, and with many
agitated glances thrown back, as one who feared
pursuit, ran, rather than walked, on to the high
road.
</p>

<p>
The moonbeams falling on that pale, wan,
terror-stricken face, revealed the scarcely
recognisable features of the gay, daring,
fascinating girl, whom ten years before we saw upon
the sands, behind Mrs. Henley's house, parting,
in such hysterical grief, from the lover whom
she then thought never could be absent from
her heart, and whom a few months afterwards
she jilted for twelve thousand a year.  Yes,
that pale, wan woman was Mrs. Meredith
Vyner; and she fled from the man for whom she
had sacrificed her name!
</p>

<p>
Her face was a pathetic commentary upon
her life.  No longer were those tiger eyes
lighted up with the fire of daring triumph, no
longer were those thin lips curled with a
smiling cruel coquetry, no longer drooped those
golden ringlets with a fairy grace.  The eyes
were dull with grief; the lips were drawn down
with constant fretfulness; the whole face
sharpened with constant fear and eagerness.  Her
beauty had vanished&mdash;her health was broken&mdash;her
gaiety was gone.  Crushed in spirit, she
was a houseless fugitive, escaping from the
most hateful of tyrants.
</p>

<p>
Retribution, swift and terrible, had fallen
upon her head.  From the moment when, in
obedience to that wild impulse, she had fled
from her husband with her saturnine lover, her
life had been one protracted torture.  Better,
oh! better far, would it have been for her to
have refused him, and to have died by his
hand, than to have followed him to such misery
as she had endured!
</p>

<p>
It would take me long to recount in detail
the sad experience of the last two years.  She
found herself linked to a man, whose diabolical
temper made her shudder when he frowned,
and whose mad, unreasonable, minute jealousy
kept her in constant terror.  She dared not look
at another man.  She was never allowed to quit
his sight for an instant.  If she sighed, it made
him angry; if she wept, it drew down
reproaches upon her, and insinuations that she
repented of the step she had taken, and wished
to leave him.  A day's peace or happiness with
such a man was impossible.  He had none of
the amiable qualities which might have made
her forget her guilty position.  Dark, passionate,
suspicious, ungenerous, and exacting, he was
always brooding over the difference between the
claims he made upon her admiration and love,
and the mode in which she responded to those
claims.  His tyrannous vanity, could only have
been propitiated by the most abject and exorbitant
adulation&mdash;adulation in word, look, and act.
She had sacrificed herself, but that was only
one act, and he demanded a continued sacrifice.
No woman had ever loved him before, yet
nothing less than idolatry, or the simulation of
it, would content him.  He could not understand
how she should have any other thought
than that of ministering to his exacting vanity.
</p>

<p>
Now, of all women, Mrs. Vyner was the last
to be capable of such a passion; and certainly,
under such circumstances, no woman could have
given way to the passion, had she felt it.  In
constant terror and perpetual remorse, what
time had she for the subtleties of love?  She
dreaded and despised him.  She saw that her
fate was inextricably inwoven with his; and&mdash;what
a humiliation!&mdash;she saw that he did not
love her!
</p>

<p>
No, Maxwell did not love her.  She had not
been with him a month before he became
aware of the fact himself.  It is a remark I
have often made, that men thwarted in their
desires confound their own wilfulness with
depth of passion.  With fierce energy, they will
move heaven and earth to gain what, when
gained, they disregard.  This is usually considered
as a proof of the strength of their love;
it only shows the strength of their self-love.
</p>

<p>
It was Maxwell's irritated vanity which
made him so persisting in his pursuit of
Mrs. Vyner.  It was his wounded vanity which
made him capable of murdering her; not his
love: for love, even when wounded, is still a
generous feeling;&mdash;it is sympathy, and admits
no hate.
</p>

<p>
What, then, was Maxwell's object in living
with Mrs. Vyner after the discovery that he
did not really love her?  Why did he not quit
her, or at least allow her to quit him?
</p>

<p>
His vanity! precisely that: the same
exacting vanity which prompted all his former
actions, prompted this.  He felt that she did
not idolize him; he knew she would be glad
to quit him;&mdash;and there was torture in the
thought.  Had she really loved him with
passionate self-oblivion, he would have deserted
her.  As it was, the same motive which had
roused his desire for her possession, which had
made him force her to sacrifice everything for
his sake, was as active now as then.  If she
left him, he was still, except for the one act of
her elopement, as far from his goal as before.
</p>

<p>
It may seem strange that, not loving her, he
should prize so highly the demonstrations of
affection from her; but those who have probed
the dark and intricate windings of the heart,
know the persistency of an unsatisfied desire,
and, above all, know the tyrannous nature of
vanity.  To this must be added the peculiar
condition of Maxwell: the condition of a man
intensely vain, who had never before been loved,
and who had, as it were, staked his existence on
subduing this one woman's heart.
</p>

<p>
What a life was theirs!  A life of ceaseless
suspicion, and of ceaseless dread&mdash;of bitter
exasperation, and of keen remorse&mdash;of unsatisfied
demands, and of baffled hope.
</p>

<p>
It lasted nearly two years.  Then Maxwell,
at the conclusion of some brutal quarrel, burst
another bloodvessel, and his life was despaired
of.  Mary was his nurse; he would have no
other.  She had to sit up with him; to attend
upon him; to submit to his petty irritability,
made worse by illness; to watch him in his
restless slumbers, hoping that each time he
closed his eyes would be the last.
</p>

<p>
One night&mdash;it was the very night on which
this chapter opened&mdash;she sat by his side
absorbed in gloomy thought.  The candle was
flaring in the socket.  Everything was still.
The dying man slept peacefully.  With her
hands drooping upon her lap, she sat allowing
her thoughts to wander; and they wandered
into the dim future, when, released from her
tyrant, she was once more a happy woman.
Long did she indulge in that sweet reverie, and
when it ceased, she turned her head mechanically
to look upon the sleeper.  He was wide awake:
his dull eyes were fixed intently upon her; and
a shiver ran all over her body as she met that
gaze!
</p>

<p>
"<i>I am not dead yet!</i>" he said, as if he had
interpreted her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
She trembled slightly.  With a sneer, he
closed his eyes again.
</p>

<p>
Silently she sat by his side, communing with
her own dark thoughts.  He slept again; slept
soundly.  She rose, and moved about the room;
it did not awaken him.  She took courage:&mdash;crept
down stairs, unfastened the door&mdash;and
fled.
</p>

<p>
Fled, and left her tyrant dying;&mdash;fled, and
left him without a human being to attend upon
him&mdash;left him to die there like a dog; or to
recover, if it should chance so.  She cared not;
her only thought was flight; and, winged with
terror, she flew from the accursed home of guilt
and wretchedness; and felt her heart beat
distractedly, as, a homeless, penniless wanderer,
she urged her steps along that dusty road under
the quiet shining moon.
</p>

<p>
Ten days afterwards, Meredith Vyner received
a long letter from his wife, detailing the
misery of her penniless condition, and imploring
pecuniary aid.  The poor, old man wept bitterly
over the letter, and again reproached himself
with having been the cause of her ruin.  He
could not forget that he had loved her&mdash;had
been happy with her.  He forgave her for not
having loved one so old as himself; and wrote
to her the following reply:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
WYTTON HALL, 2nd August, 1845.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR WIFE,
</p>

<p>
"We have both need of forgiveness&mdash;you
have mine.  I know I am not young
enough to be loved by you:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Durum! sed levius fit patientia<br>
  Quidquid corrigere est nefas,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
as our favourite says&mdash;not that the quotation
is very good.  But if you can have patience,
as I can have; if you can forget all
'incompatibilities,' and live quietly and not unhappily
with me, come back again, and all shall be
forgotten.  I will do my best to make you
happy, I promise that nothing of what has
passed shall ever be recurred to.  You shall
again be mistress of my house and fortune.
</p>

<p>
"But I do not wish to <i>force</i> you even to
this.  If, on deliberate reflection, you think you
cannot live comfortably with me, I have given
instructions to Messrs. Barton and Hadley to
remit you, wherever you may choose to reside,
eight hundred pounds a year.  Upon this you
can live in all comfort in France.  With every
wish for your happiness,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Believe me, my dear Wife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours affectionately,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H. S. MEREDITH VYNER."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This letter never reached Mrs. Vyner.
Believing that her application had been treated
with the silent scorn it deserved, she left the
town, and toiled her way to a neighbouring
town, where a young woman, formerly one of her
maids, kept a small <i>magazin de modes</i>, and
offered a temporary asylum.  There she
endeavoured to earn a subsistence by teaching
English; and at first, success crowned her
efforts; but having been recognised by an
English traveller spending a few days there, the
fact of her having eloped from her husband
became bruited about, and all her pupils left her.
</p>

<p>
She was forced to quit the place, and to seek
refuge and oblivion in Paris.  What bitter
humiliations, and what severe trials, she had
there to undergo may be readily conceived.  A
mystery hangs over her fate; she was seen once
on the <i>Boulevard du Temple</i>, miserably dressed,
and so aged by suffering, that every trace of
beauty had disappeared; but nothing has since
been heard of her.
</p>

<p>
Concerning the other persons of this tale, I
have few particulars to add.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Langley Turner has married Lord &mdash;&mdash;,
and now gives as many parties as before, only
they are fearfully dull: perhaps because so
much more "select;" for it is a very serious
truth, that your high people are anything but
entertaining.
</p>

<p>
Frank Forrester has seen many ups and
downs; but the last time I saw him, his cab
splashed me with mud as I lounged down
St. James's-street.
</p>

<p>
Rose has two chubby children, who promise
to have the spirit of the mother; they keep
the nursery in a constant uproar!
</p>

<p>
Violet has one large, dark-eyed, solemn boy,
who, though not a twelvemonth old, looks at
you with such thoughtful seriousness, that you
are puzzled what to say to him; and I refrained
tickling him under the chin, lest he should
consider it as unseemly trifling; and as to
talking to him about his tootsy-pootsies being
vezzy pitty&mdash;that never could enter the mind
even of the most ignorant nurse.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke continues his political career
with dignity and success; Violet cheering him
on, and loving him with all her large heart, so
that Rose declares, except herself and Julius,
she knows of nobody so happy as these two;&mdash;Violet
disputes the exception.
</p>

<p>
And Captain Heath?  The narration of his
happiness is a <i>bonne bouche</i> I have reserved for
the last.
</p>

<p>
The whole family were at Wytton Hall, and
though so happy in themselves, frequent were
their inquiries as to when the captain was to
come down&mdash;only one person never asked that
question, and that person was Blanche; the
reason of her silence I leave to be guessed.
</p>

<p>
He came at last; came not to see the mild,
affectionate greeting of a sister from his much
loved Blanche, but the delight, embarrassment,
and pain of one who loved and dared not avow
it.  He had been absent three months.  During
that absence, she discovered her love.  At first,
she merely felt a certain weariness; next,
succeeded melancholy; next, impatience to see
him; and finally, the yearning of her heart
proclaimed she loved him.
</p>

<p>
Yes: such is the imperfection of poor human
nature, that it cannot reach the circulating
library standard; with our best efforts to be
forlorn and disconsolate, we <i>will</i> accept of
society and consolation; with the strongest
idea of the virtue of constancy, a loving heart
cannot but love!
</p>

<p>
Blanche was embarrassed when she saw her
lover again! and he, poor fellow! was too modest
to understand her embarrassment.  In vain did
they ramble about the grounds together, not a
syllable did he breathe of his love.  Blanche
began to be almost fretful.
</p>

<p>
One morning they were playing with Rose
Blanche together, and the little toddler having
climbed upon his knee, declared she intended
to "mazzy Captain Heath some day;" upon
which her mama said a <i>leetle</i> pettishly: "No,
my darling, Captain Heath is not a <i>marrying
man</i>.  He is to be an old bachelor."
</p>

<p>
Captain Heath made no reply, for he could
not tell her why he was condemned to be an
old bachelor.
</p>

<p>
Yet, that very afternoon, as they were strolling
through the wood together, and the conversation
turned upon her child, he was moved
by some mysterious impulse, to take her hand
in his, and with a faltering voice, to say,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Blanche ... dearest Blanche ... forgive me
for what I am now going to say ... refuse the
offer if you will, but do not be offended with me
for making it ... Your child, Blanche, is growing
up ... She will soon need a better protector
than even your love ... she ... I hope you
will not misunderstand me ... I know you
cannot love me ... though I have loved you so
many years ... but I am grown used to that
... I have loved you, Blanche, for years, scarcely
ever with the hope of a return, and latterly,
with the certainty, that my love was hopeless
... But when I offer myself as a husband ... as
a protector to you, and to your child ... I
do that which, if it would not pain you, I
feel to be right ... I want to have a husband's
authority for devoting my life to you.  I do not
ask your love...!"
</p>

<p>
Her head was turned away, and her eyes
were filling with tears&mdash;tears of exquisite pain,
of inexpressible delight; as these words, "I do
not ask your love," thrilled through her, she
suddenly turned and looked him full in the
face.
</p>

<p>
Was it her blushing tremor, was it her undisguised
tenderness which spoke so clearly to the
yearning heart of her lover?  I know not.
Love has a language of its own, untranslatable
by any words of ours, and that language in its
mystic, yet unequivocal voice, told Captain
Heath, that he was loved.
